### Very quick and rough guide on how to add/edit articles

(This is taken unedited from a discord conversation, might fix later)

- You ofc need an account on github.com
- Once you have it you go to https://github.com/dreamgrove/dreamgrove/fork
- Leave everything as is, create fork
- This should link you yo https://github.com/youraccount/dreamgrove
- From here you can navigate to /data/blog/<spec>
- compendium.mdx is the file that has the contents of the webpage
- The quickest option is to do everything online
- To do this you click on the file and then on the edit button and you just do all of your edits in the browser editor
- Once you're done you click on "commit changes"
- Here you can leave the extended description empty, but for the commit message please try to always write guide: "brief changelog"
- i.e. guide: added tww trinkets
- if you forget it, it doesn't break anything, but this makes it easy to track changes over time and then you press "Commit changes"
- You can keep doing as many changes as you want like this
- Once you're satisfied you can go back to https://github.com/username/dreamgrove
- And you should see a message
- if it says that "your branch is behind" then you click sync fork > update branch. This will update your copy with the remote changes someone else might've done
- Try to keep it always up to date before making changes
- if it says "this branch is ahead" then you click contribute > open pull request
- This will notify me or any other owner of the website that you have updates. If you wait a couple of minutes on that page it should also generate you an url where you'll be able to preview the changes you made
- After you checked the preview and confirmed that everything looks good, leave a comment and we'll merge the changes
- and finally, for the compendium writing itself
- the basic formatting language is markdown, so you can use all of its features
- the already present compendiums should have examples of how to write everything you might need
- There's also this thing I wrote as documentation if you need something fancy: https://github.com/dreamgrove/dreamgrove/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
