Summary
===
Welcome to the Sepulcher of the First Ones Balance Druid encounter guide.

**DISCLAIMER:** This is a WORK IN PROGRESS guide and will be constantly updated as I, Chicken, experience the fights. 

<br>This guide tells you how to abuse your spec on a fight and NOT how to actually play the mechanics of the fight.

<br>Current guide progression: PTR/11M 


You can ask me any questions on discord Chickenxd#7777 or if you are shy just ask in the Dreamgrove Balance channel.
