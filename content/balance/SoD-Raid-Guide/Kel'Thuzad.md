## Notes For the Boss:
- Barkskin the pillar breaks.
- Look out for fulldotting adds that are not near the boss.
- Look out for Solar Beams on adds far from group.
- Prioritise Starfall over everything else.
- Sunfire the small adds if they are stacked no matter how fast they die.
- Place yourself around the middle of the room if possible in order to cleave the whole room with Starfall.
- CD Usage: Pull / another cd inside a main phase / p3 with lust

## Mythic only notes:
- CDs should always be talked with your raid and especailly if 2+ venthir moonkins are being sent down they should be alternated.
- Barkskin whenever the big spike group is about to explode. 
- Be very careful when you starfall. Good rule of thumb is to not use it whenever spikes are up unless you realise what is happening around you, when spikes are supposed to get popped and how healthy the raid is.
- If you are inside in intermission always use starfall for the winds.
