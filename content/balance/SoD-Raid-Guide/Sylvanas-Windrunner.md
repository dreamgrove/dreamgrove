## Notes For the Boss:

P1:
- Whenever chains drop make sure to pool up enough AP for one starfall. You can almost ignore the chains assuming there isnt one very far away and just continue your rotation on the boss. Make sure to position yourself in the middle of the chains if possible in order to hit all of them with your starfall.
- Use Barkskin if you are being targeted by a chain far away or whenever you are out of group on tank Black Arrow hits.
- Use Roar at the group wide chains right before p2

P2: 
- Roar the bridges before vulnerable and add phases. Alternate between 2 roars if possible.
- Use Incarn right as Sylvanas becomes vulnerable. At the 2nd vulnerable phase it might be beneficial to either prepop or hold altogether.
- Use Dash, Wild Charge and Door of Shadows on bridges.

P3:
- Pick a spot on the platform and go there every pull. That should be the case with everyone in your group in order to make movement easier.
- Barkskin whenever your group needs you to usually it is before the triple black arrows.
- If you Bloodlust on the 2nd platform, use cds there and at the very end.
- You can survive 4th platform raze at the end for a bit, the damage pattern is similar to Sludgefist wall charge.
- You can use Starfall if you are far from the next platform and are either targeted by Black Arrows or 
- Currently Door of Shadows does NOT work in this phase.
