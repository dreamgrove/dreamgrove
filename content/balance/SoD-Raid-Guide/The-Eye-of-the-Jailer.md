## Notes For the Boss:
- Stellar Drift has a lot of value in this fight as it is relatively movement heavy with a bunch of adds spawning throughout the fight. Use this whenever you help with chain grips or are cleaving an add with the boss.
- Wild Charge the puddles. If you get hit by one, you can use a Starfall with Stellar Drift and soak the ghosts.
- Door of Shadows is usable whenever you have to dodge the beam.

## Mythic only notes:
- Use Stampeding Roar whenever you are swapping adds in intermissions.
- Use Incarn at the start of every phase and in P3 with Bloodlust.
- Inside your first Ravenous Frenzy window you should use Starfall once to help cleave the first add and move with the beam a bit if you are not using Door of Shadows on it.

## Talents:

You can run either Moons or Foe as Night Fae, but i would recommend Moons as Foe can bug on the chains sometimes and its not really worth the effort trying to line up some wonky 2 target cleave for a bit more damage that is pretty irrelevant as the add gets passively cleaved down.
