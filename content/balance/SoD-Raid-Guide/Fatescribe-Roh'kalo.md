## Notes For the Boss:
- This is one of the bosses where you should focus on doing the mechanics more than doing damage if you are able to control the runes. 
- A Single Target boss with multiple adds in the intermission. Stellar Drift and Fury of Elune are highly recommended here. Line your 2nd and 4th Fury of Elune with the 2nd add splits in the intermissions. It's preferred to hold FoE for when you need it (using only 2 FoE instead of 3 every Incarn cycle), especially if Venthyr.
- Use Door of Shadows for orb drops. Try to make space for others if needed. If you are blocked off by someone else you can use 2 Doors and hop behind them if you do it fast enough.
- Wild charge and Stampeding roar aggressively if beams spawn on you and/or your group.


## Mythic only notes:
TBD

## Soulbinds:

## Talents:
- Restoration Affinity might prove to be slightly better than Guardian, because of the rejuv/swiftmend on yourself (and your partner) if you have to do runes on the other side of the room and the runes are moving faster than you are able to cast regrowth.
- Tiger's Dash might prove incredibly useful for orb drops far from raid and for traveling far if runes spawn on the other side of the room.
