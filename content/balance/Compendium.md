**DRAGONFLIGHT TALENTS:**



[Single Target](https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQFFQVQcCYBQUExRQQBFNUYRQUGZVFRGUQCVQ)


[Single Target with Add Waves](https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQEFAUQcCQhQUUxlQQBBNUYRQUGYVVVCUQCUA) - (most raid boss fights)


[aoe 2t council sustained](https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQFEQRQcCYBQUUxVQQBBNUYVQUGYVVEWQQCUA) - 5 minute Patchwerk


[aoe 3t council sustained](https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQFEQRQcCYBQUUxVQQBBNUYZQUGYVVEGQQCUA) - 5 minute Patchwerk

[M+ build](https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQEFAUQcCQhUUUxVQQBBNUYlUUGYVVECQQCUA)




DRUID TREE DEVIATIONS:

- ALWAYS take Natureâ€™s Vigil in raid and M+ unless the content is a joke.
- If you are pure ST and do not need any other utility, you can take Nature Recovery and Thick Hide while getting everything else other than Astral Influence with [this build](https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQFFQVQcCYBQUExRQQBBAA).
- If you have to pick utility, or want any other point than the build above, start by cutting the resto parts of the tree like in [this example](https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQEFAUQcCQhQUUxRQQBBAA). 
- From this point onwards, you can pick either Feline Swiftness, another point in WHI, 1-minute roar, Typhoon and so on. 
- If you want more points cut Renewal and then WHI. If you want more points elsewhere swap spec.
- If you need Decurse inside of an M+ dungeon, use [this build](https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQFFQVQcCQhQUUxQQQBBNUYlUUGYVVECQQCUA).
- If you still want Typhoon, then use [this build](https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQFEQRQcCQhUUUxRQQBBNUYlUUGYVVECQQCUA).



<div id="consumables">

# [4.Consumables:](#consumables)

</div>


<div id="potions">

## [Potions](#Potions)

</div>


[Elemental Potion of Ultimate Power](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191383/elemental-potion-of-ultimate-power) for every situation. Potion of Elemental Power is only 0.4% worse if it turns out to be far cheaper.


<div id="food">

## [Food](#food)

</div>


[Grand Banquet of the Kalu'ak](https://www.wowhead.com/item=197794/grand-banquet-of-the-kaluak) in every situation, but [Sizzling Seafood Medley](https://www.wowhead.com/item=197784/sizzling-seafood-medley) is a cheaper close contender. 


<div id="phials">

## [Phials](#Phials)

</div>

**ST**

Pure damage wise with 100% uptime on all of the Phials and not counting in the downsides their hierarchy is as follows on ST:

- [Phial of Static Empowerment](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191338/phial-of-static-empowerment)
- [Phial of Charged Isolation](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191332/phial-of-charged-isolation)
- [Iced Phial of Corrupting Rage](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191329/iced-phial-of-corrupting-rage), has ~80% of the value of Static/Isolation Phials at max value.
- [Phial of Elemental Chaos](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191359/phial-of-elemental-chaos), has ~55% of the value of Static/Isolation Phials at max value. This means if you can't get more than 55% uptime on those you should use this Phial.
- [Phial of Tepid Versatility](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191341/phial-of-tepid-versatility), same as the Elemental one, only that vers is more often better during progress than the random stats. Should be the default phial in most situations.
- [Phial of Glacial Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191335/phial-of-glacial-fury), do not use this on single target.

**AoE**:

The priority is the same as it is on ST with the exception of Glacial Fury which gains a large amount of value when you frequently hit new targets. This means that you should always use Glacial Fury in M+ and any raid encounters with frequent add spawns that need to die.

<div id="gearing">

# [5.Gearing:](#gearing)

</div>


<div id="stats">
 
## [Stat Priority:](#stats)

</div>

Sim yourself using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). Do not follow any stat priorities.



<div id="embellishments">

## [Embellishments](#embellishments)

</div>

**ST:**
The best embellishments raw damage wise at full uptime are [Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375323/elemental-lariat) and [Bronzed Grip Wrappings](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396442/bronzed-grip-wrappings). 
<br>A close contender is [Blue Silken Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=387335/blue-silken-lining) at full uptime, which should in my opinion not be considered on pure ST.
<br>[Potion Absorption Inhibitor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371700/potion-absorption-inhibitor) should be considered instead of Bronzed Grip Wrappings since swapping Embellishments at least early on is not an option easily.

**AOE:**
The best embellishments  are [Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375323/elemental-lariat) and [Blue Silken Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=387335/blue-silken-lining) at max value. 
<br>A close contender is [Potion Absorption Inhibitor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371700/potion-absorption-inhibitor) so it is recommend to stick with this and [Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375323/elemental-lariat) for nearly all situations.

**TLDR:** 
[Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375323/elemental-lariat) (always use) > [Bronzed Grip Wrappings](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396442/bronzed-grip-wrappings) (ST) = [Potion Absorption Inhibitor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371700/potion-absorption-inhibitor) (AoE) > [Blue Silken Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=387335/blue-silken-lining) (better in a scenario where you barely take damage)


<div id="tier-set">

## [Tier Set](#tier-set)

2PC: 2% DPS ST, 2.5% AoE 
<br>4PC: 12% DPS ST, 12.5% AoE
<br>TLDR: Loot or bench

How to use the 4PC procs can be found in the [Rotation](#rotation) section. ({{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} ST, {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} AoE)

<div id="trinkets">

## [Trinkets](#trinkets)

<br>[Idol of the Earth Warder](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193006/idol-of-the-earth-warder?class=11&ilvl=418&spec=102) - Jewelcrafting / AH !! This trinket is only good if you have a lot of sockets in your gear !!
<br>[Darkmoon Deck: Inferno](https://www.wowhead.com/item=198086/darkmoon-deck-inferno?class=11&ilvl=418&spec=102) - Inscription / AH



<div id="gearing-advice">

## [Gearing Advice](#gearing-advice)

</div>

In general try to hit ilvl > mastery gear. If it has mastery it is most likely good, it does NOT need haste or anything else. For stuff that does not have mastery just sim in between dungeons.

**Dungeons to Spam:**

Nokhud Offensive - In general insane loot, really good trinket, a lot of mastery gear. If you are pugging keys and are able to target try to run this dungeon.
<br>Halls of Valor - This dungeon is really heavy on mastery gear and the trinkets are also pretty good. Do not reroll this dungeon.
<br>Algeth'Ar Academy - Good for weapon hunting, it has a low drop pool so you can get it relatively fast.
<br>Court of Stars - Although the loot pool is diluted, Signet of Melandrus is around 400 agility for Feral if you will at all play that. Infernal Writ is also a really solid trinket. 
<br>Temple of the Jade Serpent - Although the loot pool is diluted, there are some decent pieces and a really good main hand. Do not go out of your way to spam this, but do not reroll this either.

**Dungeons to Reroll:**

<br>Shadowmoon Burial Grounds - Unless the loot table gets purged a lot on live try to reroll this dungeon as you can not target most of the loot and mainstat jewelry is worse than normal ones.
<br>Ruby Life Pools - Good for weapon if you do not have one yet, otherwise skip unless someone in your group needs this or you need score.
<br>Azure Vault - Mostly garbage loot, skip unless someone in your group needs this or you need score.



<div id="misc">

# [6. Miscellaneous:](#misc)

</div>


<div id="snapshot">

## [Do our dots snapshot?](#snapshot)

</div>

No, all of our periodic damage (like {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}, {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}}, {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare " >}}) does NOT snapshot, everything is dynamic. That means any dots gain/lose the damage bonus upon entering/leaving the Eclipse that buffs them and whenever any other stat/damage increases are applied/expire.




<div id="owlkin-frenzy">

## [How do I use Owlkin Frenzy procs?](#owlkin-frenzy)

</div>

When Lunar Eclipse is active use {{< spell 157228 "Owlkin Frenzy" >}} procs as soon as possible. When ONLY Solar Eclipse(should currently never be the case) is active, use it when fighting 3+ targets or when you need to move. Otherwise let it expire.





<div id="astral-damage">
 
## [What is Astral damage?](#astral-damage)

</div>

Astral damage is Arcane and Nature damage at the same time meaning that these spells benefit from effects that buff either spell school and get increased by both type of boosts multiplicatively. Mind that class buffs only affect class spells so if a trinket does nature or arcane damage they are not affected by our buffs to these spell classes.
