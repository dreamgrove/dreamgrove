## 10.0.5 Updates

### Summary of the changes

10.0.5 is here and brings a number of updates to our class and spec tree (you can check the update out [here](https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/balance)). The class tree changes have no major impact but we can get Remove Corruption, Cyclone or Hibernate easier and a 5s CDR on Typhoon in the form of a new talent, Incessant Tempest. Forestwalk (the Regrowth buffing talent) will unlikely see play as we currently use Bear Form->Frenzied to survive and is generally pretty underwhelming for its positioning in the tree. The changes to the Balance tree and spec have a much larger impact:

- Circle has been reworked into Cosmic Rapidity which has the same effect except our dots no longer last shorter. This means far less redotting in all scenarios.
- Solar Beam now always has to be picked, meaning it is more or less baseline. No more excuses why you didn't kick.
- Lunar Eclipse now increases the AoE damage of Starfire instead of its crit chance. The implication of this is a very large stacked AoE buff but also more reliance on being able to cast Starfire which is often not a given. This also heavily increases the value of all our filler talents in stacked AoE scenarios.
- A lot of talent position shuffling which forces us into different build paths.

Playstyle wise these changes are positive as the short dot duration has been one of the biggest complaints about the spec, similarly to Solar Beam costing DPS. <br>
In terms of tuning, the Lunar Eclipse changes shift our damage profile in AoE scenarios by pushing far more damage into Starfire. ~~While this is currently "just" a large buff, it will inevitably be nerfed in some form and leave us more reliant on hard casting Starfire for better or worse.~~ It has been nerfed :)


### New talent builds

The following builds are what currently sims highest for the given scenarios but may not be perfect yet. Take with a grain of salt.
Pure Single Target aka Terros:<br>
https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQEBEBBBkkIFRRTGVBCAQMVUFQSFSoZkFQCFU
With the new tree we can skip Starfall if there is a fight such as Terros which allows it. The result of this is picking Force of Nature and Starweaver not working anymore which results in this build.

Sustained 4 targets aka Council:<br>
https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQEBEBBBgkYFRRTGVBCEQMVQUWaFSgZgBQBQ
This is the result of the previously mentioned Lunar Eclipse change. In this build we take all our filler Talents to allow Starfire to shine, even skipping Mushrooms. Compared to the previously optimal build for Council, this build is a ~~14%~~ 6% dps increase meaning we will gap everyone else by a ~~large~~ fairly large margin on that boss. Unfortunately this build gives up more or less all our single target dps so the uses of it are very limited. It remains to be seen if it will find play in more scenarios.

Possible dungeon build and mixed target boss fights:<br>
https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQEBEBBBgkYFRRTGVBCFQMVQUUSFSoZkFQCQA
This build basically maximizes the talents that are either must pick in ST/AoE or buff both. Starweaver in M+ is also looking to be a viable pick outside of very heavy AoE dungeons as it is better on both bosses and packs that have mobs with a larger hp pool. Wild Mushroom is still our best burst AoE talent so it will still be taken for bosses where it is required(for example Dathea), for lower M+ dungeons and whenever the average pull is too big to consistently flare. Additionally Mushrooms are a movement global we are sorely lacking so they will still see play in a lot of dungeons and bosses. A build with them would look like this: https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQEBEBBBgkYFRRTGVBCFQMVQUUSFSpVkRQCUA
Nonetheless they have lost a lot of relative value as they replace a Starfire cast.

### Other minor rotational changes
- We now Starfire during CA/Inc on 2+ targets instead of 4+.
- Stellar Flare is no longer worth casting on 11 targets minus 1 per point in Astral Smolder or Umbral Intensity. This means that with both Astral Smolder and Umbral Intensity at 2/2 we stop using Stellar Flare on 7 targets. Additionally it now requires the target to live 8s+1 per target Starfire can hit.
- Not a change but worth noting: Nothing changes about us entering Lunar Eclipse and filling with Wrath outside 2+ 2pc stacks or Umbral Embrace on ST except if you have 2/2 Umbral Intensity talented.

- Use {{< spell 202425 "Warrior of Elune" >}} if available.
- Use {{< spell 391528 "Convoke the Spirits" >}} when below 40 AP if you are inside a {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}} or {{< spell 102560 "Inc" >}} window, or if your next {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}} or {{< spell 102560 "Inc" >}} window is 30 or more seconds away.

- Use {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} if {{< spell 202345 "Starlord" >}} has less than 3 stacks and if talented you can optimally refresh your {{< spell 393954 "Rattle the Stars" >}} buff.
- Use {{< spell 274281 "New-" >}}, {{< spell 202768 "Half-" >}} and {{< spell 202771 "Full Moon" >}} if you will not overcap on AP.

- Use {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} You should always be in Lunar Eclipse but casting Wrath is still a DPS increase.

<div id="aoe">

## [What is my AoE rotation?](#aoe)

</div>

- Use {{< spell 202425 "Warrior of Elune" >}} if available.
- Use {{< spell 88747 "Wild Mushroom" >}} if you will not overcap on AP. If you are using {{< spell 392999 "Fungal Growth" >}} and {{< spell 393956 "Waning Twilight" >}} make sure to not use it if the debuff is up already.
- Use {{< spell 211545 "Fury of Elune" >}} or {{< spell 202771 "Full Moon" >}} if you will not overcap on AP.
- Use {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare" >}} if the target(s) will live for at least 8s+1s per target that {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} can hit and you will not overcap on AP.
- Use {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} if one of the following conditions are true:
    - You have a {{< spell 393942 "Starweaver's Warp" >}} proc.
    - {{< spell 202345 "Starlord" >}} is below 3 stacks.
- Use {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} if you have a {{< spell 393944 "Starweaver's Weft" >}} proc and {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} will hit less than 3 targets.
- Use {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} if you have 3x T29 2piece stacks or an {{< spell 393760 "Umbral Embrace" >}} proc and you will not overcap on AP.
- Use {{< spell 400636 "Astral Communion" >}} if you will not overcap on AP.
- Use {{< spell 391528 "Convoke the Spirits" >}} if {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} would only hit 2 targets, otherwise only use {{< spell 391528 "Convoke" >}} for movement in AoE.
- Use {{< spell 274281 "New Moon" >}} and {{< spell 202768 "Half Moon" >}} if you will not overcap on AP.
- Use {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} if you have a {{< spell 393944 "Starweaver's Weft" >}} proc and {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} will hit less than 17 targets.
- Use {{< spell 194153 "Wrath" >}} if {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} will only hit one target during {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}/{{< spell 102560 "Inc" >}}.
- Use {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}}.


<div id="filler">

## [What is my filler priority inside CA/Inc?](#filler)

</div>


Inside of {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}/{{< spell 102560 "Inc" >}} your fillers will be {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} on Single Target and {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} on 2 or more targets.


<div id="pulsar">

## [Why do we proc pulsar with starfall?](#pulsar)

The reason we proc {{< spell 393961 "Pulsar" >}} in single target situations with Starfall (if CA/INC is not already active) is due to the buffs gained upon entering CA such as {{< spell 394050 "BoAT" >}} and {{< spell 194223 "Celestial Alignment" >}}.
  
The damage dealt by Starfall updates dynamically during its duration and can benefit from those buffs (with the exception of the initial tick). Starsurge on the other hand is executed before these buffs apply and will not benefit from them.
  
 
 <div id="mushroom">

## [How do we use Wild Mushrooms and how do they work?](#mushroom)
 
{{< spell 88747 "Wild Mushroom" >}} deals damage in an explosion and then applies a DOT  called {{< spell 392999 "Fungal Growth" >}}(if talented). This DOT lasts for 8 seconds and deals 70% of the explosions damage over the course of its duration. {{< spell 88747 "Wild Mushroom" >}} has 3 charges, so if all 3 charges are used in quick succession and each apply a dot dealing 1000 damage, the total damage dealt by the DOT would be 3000 (1000 damage x 3 charges), and the duration of the DOT would be refreshed to 8 seconds.

This type of DOT is often called "Ignite" based on a Mage spell working this exact way. You dont lose/gain any damage by staggering them or pressing them all at once.

On single target, it's best to use all 3 charges at once paired with any available buffs such as potion, trinkets, CA. {{< spell 88747 "Wild Mushroom" >}} is also an instant GCD, so it can be used for movement as needed.

In AoE scenarios, you can use the charges all at once for a quick burst of damage or stagger them to get {{< spell 393956 "Waning Twilight" >}} up.

In Mythic+, it's best to stagger the charges to get {{< spell 393956 "Waning Twilight" >}} up on all mobs before you've managed to apply {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare" >}}.

<div id="potions">

## [Potions](#Potions)

</div>


[Elemental Potion of Ultimate Power](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191383/elemental-potion-of-ultimate-power) for every situation. Potion of Elemental Power is only 0.4% worse if it turns out to be far cheaper.


<div id="food">

[Grand Banquet of the Kalu'ak](https://www.wowhead.com/item=197794/grand-banquet-of-the-kaluak) in every situation, but [Sizzling Seafood Medley](https://www.wowhead.com/item=197784/sizzling-seafood-medley) is a cheaper close contender. 


<div id="phials">

## [Phials](#Phials)

</div>

**ST**

Pure damage wise with 100% uptime on all of the Phials and not counting in the downsides their hierarchy is as follows on ST:

- [Phial of Static Empowerment](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191338/phial-of-static-empowerment)
- [Phial of Charged Isolation](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191332/phial-of-charged-isolation)
- [Iced Phial of Corrupting Rage](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191329/iced-phial-of-corrupting-rage), has ~80% of the value of Static/Isolation Phials at max value.
- [Phial of Elemental Chaos](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191359/phial-of-elemental-chaos), has ~55% of the value of Static/Isolation Phials at max value. This means if you can't get more than 55% uptime on those you should use this Phial.
- [Phial of Tepid Versatility](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191341/phial-of-tepid-versatility), same as the Elemental one, only that vers is more often better during progress than the random stats. Should be the default phial in most situations.
- [Phial of Glacial Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191335/phial-of-glacial-fury), after nerfs this Phial should never be used.

**AoE**:

The priority is the same as it is on ST.

<div id="embellishments">

## [Embellishments](#embellishments)

</div>

**ST:**
The best embellishments raw damage wise at full uptime are [Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375323/elemental-lariat) and [Slimy Expulsion Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193451/slimy-expulsion-boots). 
<br>[Potion Absorption Inhibitor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371700/potion-absorption-inhibitor) should usually be taken instead of Slimy Expulsion Boots since swapping Embellishments, at least early on, is not an option easily.
<br>Another option is [Blue Silken Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=387335/blue-silken-lining) at very high uptime, which should can be considered when you are sure you will rarely fall below 90%. In raid this is never the case and the same goes for most dungeons.

**AOE:**
The best embellishments  are [Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375323/elemental-lariat) and [Potion Absorption Inhibitor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371700/potion-absorption-inhibitor) in nearly all situations. 
<br>As for single target [Blue Silken Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=387335/blue-silken-lining) is an option if it gets very high uptime but this is essentially never the case.

**TLDR:** 
[Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375323/elemental-lariat) (always use) > [Slimy Expulsion Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193451/slimy-expulsion-boots) (ST) = [Potion Absorption Inhibitor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371700/potion-absorption-inhibitor) (AoE)

**What to craft:**
Before you make your decision on what to craft you should clear as much of the raid as possible. All crafted pieces should be crafted with mastery/haste.
<br>Your first craft should be [Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193001/elemental-lariat?bonus=8960:8782:8793&ilvl=418&spec=102), it performs really well in all situations, after that you can choose to craft either of the following depending on your gear:
<br>[Signet of Titanic Insight](https://www.wowhead.com/item=192999/signet-of-titanic-insight) Ring crafted by jewelcrafting
<br>[Primal Molten Spellblade](https://www.wowhead.com/item=190506/primal-molten-spellblade) 1H dagger crafted by blacksmithing
<br>[Life-Bound Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193398/life-bound-boots) Boots crafted by leatherworking



<div id="tier-set">

## [Tier Set](#tier-set)

2PC: 2% DPS ST, 2.5% AoE 
<br>4PC: 12% DPS ST, 12.5% AoE
<br>2+4PC: 14% DPS ST, 15% AoE
<br>TLDR: Loot or bench

<div id="trinkets">

## [Trinkets](#trinkets)

</div>

Obviously, just like before please use the Top Gear or Droptimizer options in Raidbots in order to decide what trinkets to farm/use, but the following list should give you a good idea of some of the trinkets you will want to look out for.

On Single Target you will want to use [Furious Ragefeather](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193677/furious-ragefeather?bonus=7974&class=11&ilvl=415&spec=102) and one of the following trinkets:

[Whispering Incarnate Icon](https://www.wowhead.com/item=194301/whispering-incarnate-icon?bonus=7935&class=11&ilvl=421&spec=102) - The Primal Council (Raid)
<br>[Spiteful Storm](https://www.wowhead.com/item=194309/spiteful-storm?bonus=7979&class=11&ilvl=424&spec=102) - Raszageth (Raid)
<br>[Desperate Invoker's Codex](https://www.wowhead.com/item=194310/desperate-invokers-codex?bonus=7935) - Raszageth (Raid), Inflicts a great amount of damage to yourself and should not be considered in a progression environment.
<br>[Conjured Chillglobe](https://www.wowhead.com/item=194300/conjured-chillglobe?bonus=7935&class=11&ilvl=415&spec=102) - The Primal COuncil (Raid)
<br>[Eye of Skovald](https://www.wowhead.com/item=133641/eye-of-skovald?bonus=1795&ilvl=415&spec=102) - Halls of Valor
<br>[Darkmoon Deck: Inferno](https://www.wowhead.com/item=198086/darkmoon-deck-inferno?class=11&ilvl=418&spec=102) - Inscription / AH
<br>[Windscar Whetstone](https://www.wowhead.com/item=137486/windscar-whetstone?bonus=6652:8811:8812:6808:4786:3294&ilvl=415&spec=102) - Court of Stars, good on-use ST trinket, mind that the damage it does is shared amongst enemies hit.

## [Gearing Advice](#gearing-advice)

</div>

In general try to hit ilvl > mastery gear. If it has mastery it is most likely good, it does NOT need haste or anything else. For stuff that does not have mastery just sim in between dungeons.

**Dungeons to Spam:**

Nokhud Offensive - In general insane loot, really good trinket, a lot of mastery gear. If you are pugging keys and are able to target try to run this dungeon.
<br>Halls of Valor - This dungeon is really heavy on mastery gear and the trinkets are also pretty good. Do not reroll this dungeon.
<br>Algeth'Ar Academy - Good for weapon hunting, it has a low drop pool so you can get it relatively fast.
<br>Court of Stars - Although the loot pool is diluted, Signet of Melandrus is around 400 agility for Feral if you will at all play that. Infernal Writ is also a really solid trinket. 
<br>Temple of the Jade Serpent - Although the loot pool is diluted, there are some decent pieces and a really good main hand. Do not go out of your way to spam this, but do not reroll this either.

**Dungeons to Reroll:**

<br>Shadowmoon Burial Grounds - Unless the loot table gets purged a lot on live try to reroll this dungeon as you can not target most of the loot and mainstat jewelry is worse than normal ones.
<br>Ruby Life Pools - Good for weapon if you do not have one yet, otherwise skip unless someone in your group needs this or you need score.
<br>Azure Vault - Mostly garbage loot, skip unless someone in your group needs this or you need score.

<div id="snapshot">

## [Do our dots snapshot?](#snapshot)

</div>

No, all of our periodic damage (like {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}, {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}}, {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare " >}}) does NOT snapshot, everything is dynamic. That means any dots gain/lose the damage bonus upon entering/leaving the Eclipse that buffs them and whenever any other stat/damage increases are applied/expire.




<div id="owlkin-frenzy">

## [How do I use Owlkin Frenzy procs?](#owlkin-frenzy)

</div>

When Lunar Eclipse is active use {{< spell 157228 "Owlkin Frenzy" >}} procs as soon as possible. When ONLY Solar Eclipse(should currently never be the case) is active, use it when fighting 3+ targets or when you need to move. Otherwise let it expire.





<div id="astral-damage">
 
## [What is Astral damage?](#astral-damage)

</div>

Astral damage is Arcane and Nature damage at the same time meaning that these spells benefit from effects that buff either spell school and get increased by both type of boosts multiplicatively. Mind that class buffs only affect class spells so if a trinket does nature or arcane damage they are not affected by our buffs to these spell classes.
