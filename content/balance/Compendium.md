[Changelog](https://github.com/dreamgrove/dreamgrove/commits/master/content/balance)

If you're a visual learner there is also a [video explanation of the compendium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzDBvOrlvjA). It was made during 10.2 but most of the concepts still apply.

## Season 4 News

### Tier Set

#### {{< spell 394412 "2-piece" >}}:

> {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} and {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} increase the damage of your next {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} or {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} by 50%, stacking up to 3 times

This is roughly a 6.2% DPS increase from having no tier.

You can treat this buff either as a passive or try stacking it to 3 before using a generator, as per usual pooling for movement and getting starlord up has higher prio.

#### {{< spell 394414 "4-piece" >}}:

> When you enter {{< spell 79577 "Eclipse" >}}, your next {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} or {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} cost 30 less Astral Power and deals 60% increased damage.

This is roughly a 7.8% DPS increase from having no tier.

The buff gives you a reduced cost on your next spender every time you enter {{< spell 79577 "Eclipse" >}}. Buff is also applied when activating {{< spell 393960 "Pulsar" >}} or pressing {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}/{{< spell 102560 "Incarnation" >}}

Total DPS from set: ~14.5%

### Antique Bronze Bullion

Season 4 brings back the Dinar system from Season 4 in Shadowlands, now under the name Antique Bronze Bullion. You will acquire this currency gradually from playing the game and it will allow you to buy "special" items from any of the 3 Dragonflight raids.

Before making any decisions on what you should spend this currency on, you should always sim your character using Droptimizer or Top Gear functions on [Raidbots](https://raidbots.com)

Here are items you should potentially spend the Antique Bronze Bullion on

- [Vakash, the Shadowed Inferno](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207788/vakash-the-shadowed-inferno)
- [Neltharion's Call to Suffering](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=204211/neltharions-call-to-suffering)
- [Whispering Incarnate Icon](https://www.wowhead.com/item=194301/whispering-incarnate-icon)
- [Seal of Diurna's Chosen](https://www.wowhead.com/item=195480/seal-of-diurnas-chosen)
- [Dreambinder, Loom of the Great Cycle](https://www.wowhead.com/item=208616/dreambinder-loom-of-the-great-cycle)
- [Seal of Filial Duty](https://www.wowhead.com/item=195526/seal-of-filial-duty)
- [Voice of the Silent Star](https://www.wowhead.com/item=204465/voice-of-the-silent-star)

## [Precasting](#precast)

</div>

**Precasting:**

You can precast from max range 4 seconds before a boss is pulled.

**What is a priority list?**

When reading the priority lists below, you should not think of these as steps to be followed in a specific order. At any given point in combat, you should cast the first ability on the list that you are able to cast, provided the conditions for its use are met.

<br><div id="woe">

## [How to Use Warrior of Elune](#woe)

 </div>
 
{{< spell 202425 "Warrior of Elune" >}} is an off-gcd ability, making your next 3 {{< spell 194153 "Starfires" >}} instant for 25 seconds. The ability has a 45s cooldown that starts once you've pressed it.

{{< spell 202425 "Warrior of Elune" >}} can be used 7 seconds before an eclipse ends, this way you will have just enough time to spend your third charge before the buff runs out and the CD will start earlier, which can net you more uses throughout the fight.

Use the charges to enter Solar Eclipse or as a movement GCD in {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}} /{{< spell 102560 "Inc" >}} /{{< spell 48518 "Lunar Eclipse" >}}. Using a Warrior of Elune Starfire in single target during {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}} /{{< spell 102560 "Inc" >}} is NOT a damage increase if you do not need to move.

If Warrior of Elune is falling off during {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}} /{{< spell 102560 "Inc" >}} and you still have a charge to spend, you can {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} at 2+ targets.

Warrior of Elune can also be used during {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}} /{{< spell 102560 "Inc" >}} /{{< spell 48518 "Lunar Eclipse" >}} when there are adds up, this will net you a lot of Astral Power which can be useful to target down a specific add or to provide more boss damage by utilizing the AP on Starsurges.

Use {{< spell 157228 "Owlkin Frenzy" >}} procs to enter Solar Eclipse, inside Lunar Eclipse or inside {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}/{{< spell 102560 "Inc" >}} if Starfire will hit 3 or more targets.
<br>Keep in mind that {{< spell 202425 "Warrior of Elune" >}} charges are consumed before {{< spell 157228 "Owlkin Frenzy" >}} procs.

{{< spell 274281 "New Moon" >}} provides more single target damage and is easy to pair with pulsar.
<br>{{< spell 211545 "FoE" >}} does slightly more AoE but is more difficult to align with {{< spell 393961 "Pulsar" >}}, making it annoying to play.

The below picture showcases which talents are "mandatory" and which talents you can opt-in to:

<b>Secondary builds:</b>

[Class tree with Hibernate for Incorporeal](https://raidbots.com/simbot/render/talents/BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgCAJJJCSCBJJSiUgWiDkkkUSCJHIEaSJCJRDgCAE?bgcolor=000000)
<br>[If you really need both Hibernate and Remove Corruption](https://raidbots.com/simbot/render/talents/BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgCQkkkISSAkESiUgWiDkkkUSCJHIEaSJCJRDgCAE?bgcolor=000000)

- {{<spell 377842 "Ursine Vigor">}}, {{<spell 377847 "Well-Honed Instincts">}} and {{<spell 288826 "Improved Stampeding Roar">}} are the major competing talents. {{<spell 377842 "Ursine Vigor">}} should be taken if you need it to survive certain abilities. {{<spell 377847 "Well-Honed Instincts">}} is always on 1 point but a 2nd can be taken if you rarely/never use Bear Form. {{<spell 288826 "Improved Stampeding Roar">}} is extremely useful in indoor dungeons and in spiteful weeks.
- {{<spell 2782 "Remove Corruption">}} should be taken in Afflicted weeks.
- {{<spell 33786 "Cyclone">}} has basically no use other than stopping Bursting and can be replaced with anything else(which also won't have any use).
- {{<spell 2637 "Hibernate">}} can be used for the Incorporeal affix.
- For lower keys, you can put 1 point into {{<spell 131768 "Feline Swiftness">}} like [this](https://raidbots.com/simbot/render/talents/BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgCAJiIIJSQSikIFHgWiDEJJlkQSChmUiEJRDgCAE?bgcolor=000000). This skips {{<spell 377842 "Ursine Vigor">}} and {{<spell 132469 "Typhoon">}}. You can also drop any of the other bottom talents you don't need to get a 2nd point in {{<spell 131768 "Feline Swiftness">}} to get around even quicker for farming keys.
- All other talents in the druid tree are more or less set.

**ST & AoE**

Damage wise, with 100% uptime on all of the Phials and not counting in the downsides their hierarchy is as follows on ST:

- https://www.wowhead.com/item=191329/iced-phial-of-corrupting-rage: Default phial unless the fight has too high damage intake or you are at risk of dying. Do not use this in progress fights unless you really need the damage.
- https://www.wowhead.com/item=191341/phial-of-tepid-versatility: Has the same value as Corrupting Rage at 60% uptime. Can be worth to play if the damage intake is high.
- https://www.wowhead.com/item=191359/phial-of-elemental-chaos: : Generally similar dps throughput as Tepid Versatility, but less defensive benefits.

<br><div id="embellishments">

## [Embellishments](#embellishments)

</div>

### For embellishments there are a couple of options this season:

- https://www.wowhead.com/item=193452/toxic-thorn-footwraps with https://www.wowhead.com/item=193555/toxified-armor-patch.
  - Provides great single target damage and has an early spike since only the boots needs to be crafted at 525 for the effect to scale to that itemlevel.
  - Locks you in to boots as your crafted items with predfefined stats.
- https://www.wowhead.com/item=204710/shadowflame-tempered-armor-patch
  - Good single target damage.
  - Deals a small amount of self-damage.
  - Can be added to any crafted leather slot.
- https://www.wowhead.com/item=208189/verdant-conduit
  - Performs slightly worse in single target.
  - Performs well in aoe.
  - Can be added to any crafted leather slot.
- https://www.wowhead.com/item=193001/elemental-lariat
  - Requires a lot of gems.
  - Performs well in AoE and Single Target.
  - Locks you in to a crafted neck but you can choose the stats on it freely.
- https://www.wowhead.com/item=193946/blue-silken-lining
  - Performs the best of all embellishments both in AoE and Single Target.
  - Requires you to be above 90% health for it to be active.
  - Can be applied on any crafted item.

### Which embellishments should you choose?

This is entirely up to you, below are some guidelines to make your choice more informed.

- https://www.wowhead.com/item=193946/blue-silken-lining provides the most amount of DPS given that you have the uptime for it(usually more than 40%). Can be swapped at any point by recrafting and adding/removing the embellishment.
- https://www.wowhead.com/item=193452/toxic-thorn-footwraps is a single target focused embellishment with an early power spike. Locks yourself with crafted boots with predfefined stats.
- https://www.wowhead.com/item=204710/shadowflame-tempered-armor-patch and https://www.wowhead.com/item=208189/verdant-conduit are good for the flexibility, you can change these around at any point depending on what fits the content you're doing.
- https://www.wowhead.com/item=193001/elemental-lariat performs well in both Single Target and AoE, but requires a lot of gems and locks yourself with a crafted neck as the embellishment can't be removed from it.

### What slot should i craft in?

This will depend on your current gear situtation, below are some guidelines:

- Bracers are often used as they have the lowest stat budget and can have a socket. This will be good later on when your other pieces can be upgraded to 525 itemlevel.
- Cloaks are another slot with the lowest stat budget, but they can't be socketed.
- Belts have a higher stat budget, but they can have a socket.
- A Ring, if you've chosen to craft https://www.wowhead.com/item=193946/blue-silken-lining, is another good slot. It also comes with a socket.

<br><div id="trinkets">

## [Trinkets](#trinkets)

</div>

[Umbreiskul's Fractured Heart](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193639/umbrelskuls-fractured-heart) is simming better than a lot of other options at lower ilvl. It may be worth getting this trinket early on in the season, but it loses value on higher ilvls. 

Doing [Dawn of the Infinite](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=14514/dawn-of-the-infinite) on hard mode without your group dying can reward you with a [Mirror of Fractured Tomorrows](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207581/mirror-of-fractured-tomorrows) at myth track, making it possible to upgrade it to 528. This makes the trinket perform very good in both ST and AoE and should be your ideal on-use trinket if you manage to get your hands on it.

[Vessel of Searing Shadow](https://www.wowhead.com/item=202615/vessel-of-searing-shadow) is simming very good when paired with [Seal of Diurna's Chosen ](https://www.wowhead.com/item=195480/seal-of-diurnas-chosen) for ST. These items are not that good seperately, but together they are outperforming other options by around 0.5%

Please use Top Gear or Droptimizer on [Raidbots](https://raidbots.com) in order to decide what trinkets to use/farm, but the following list should give you a good idea of some of the trinkets you will want to look out for. The list is in roughly power-level order assuming the highest item level versions of the trinkets.

- [Neltharion's Call to Suffering](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=204211/neltharions-call-to-suffering)
- [Mirror of Fractured Tomorrows](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=207581/mirror-of-fractured-tomorrows?bonus=4795&class=11&ilvl=525&spec=102)
- [Vessel of Searing Shadow](https://www.wowhead.com/item=202615/vessel-of-searing-shadow)
- [Irideus Fragment](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=193743/irideus-fragment)
- [Whispering Incarnate Icon](https://www.wowhead.com/item=194301/whispering-incarnate-icon)
- [Spoils of Neltharus](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193773/spoils-of-neltharus)

## [FAQ](#faq)

</div>

### I've read the priority list and I think my rotation looks correct but I'm still doing very low damage. What could be the reason?

Log one of your fights and check it with [warcraftlogs](https://articles.warcraftlogs.com/help/how-to-navigate-through-logs) and [wowanalyzer](https://wowanalyzer.com/). The main thing to check is if you're always casting: the timeline should have no downtime and, as close to zero as possible, cancelled casts. Another common issue is incorrectly planning your movement and wasting casts on dots: you should always have enough AP to cover some distance just by using spenders.

### How do I sim for AoE?

Balance Druid's gear mostly doesn't change from ST to AoE so simming "5m 1t patchwerk" is usually fine even for AoE situations. Other sims like "5t 40s" are unrealistic scenarios that will provide skewed and wrong sims in most cases and hence shouldn't be used. If you want to do an accurate M+ sim consider using the [MDT Sim WeakAura](https://wago.io/Yya4XBbl-) and remember that ST fights are still a big part of Mythic+.

### I'm doing really low damage in Mythic+, what am I doing wrong?

If you double-checked your rotation and still feel like you're underperforming you could just be playing low keys, together with classes that have very bursty damage profiles. When playing a Balance Druid, mobs need to live long enough for you to actually start doing damage, which is something that doesn't really happen in keys lower than 20+ and especially on Tyrannical. Consider focusing a bit more on ST or trying another spec, but take into account the fact that DPS isn't everything in a key.

### I've seen a lot of people running build X instead of Y in Mythic+, is X better?

This season there are many viable builds and in the end, once the necessary talents are taken, it just comes down to personal preference. One notable example is the choice between {{< spell 202770 "Fury Of Elune" >}} and {{< spell 274281 "New Moon" >}}: the former performs slightly better in AoE scenarios, while the latter is slightly better in ST, so people will usually pick the one they're most comfortable with. Feel free to use any of the builds mentioned in the Talents section.

### How do I track our tierset?

You can use the [following WeakAura](https://wago.io/BoomkinTierSet)

### How can I proc {{< spell 393956 "Waning Twilight" >}} without mushrooms or flare?

With {{< spell 394058 "Astral Smolder" >}}

### Why are some top players running different embellishments from the ones mentioned in the Compendium

The DPS gain provided by the embellishments can vary significantly because of many external factors such as gear, type of content and group composition. Some of the top players might also happen to use niche embellishments for the same reasons. If you don't have any specific requirements then your best option is to just sim your character and choose the embellishments that provide the highest DPS upgrade.

<div id="snapshot">

## [Do our dots snapshot?](#snapshot)

</div>

No, all of our periodic damage (like {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}, {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}}, {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare" >}}) do NOT snapshot, everything is dynamic. That means any dots gain/lose the damage bonus upon entering/leaving the Eclipse that buffs them and whenever any other stat/damage increases are applied/expire.

<div id="astral-damage">
 
## [What is Astral damage?](#astral-damage)

</div>

Astral damage is both Arcane and Nature damage. Effects that buff Nature spells also applies to Astral spells, and effects that buff Arcane spells likewise also applies to Astral spells. For example, Solar Eclipse multiplies the damage of all Nature & Astral spells by 1.15x, and Lunar Eclipse multiplies the damage of all Arcane & Astral spells by 1.15x. If you have both eclipses, Astral spells get 1.15 \* 1.15 = 1.3225x multiplier, while Nature & Arcane spells get 1.15x.

Mind that class buffs only affect class spells so if a trinket does nature or arcane damage they are not affected by our buffs to these spell schools.

## [Useful WeakAura(s)](#wa)

</div>

### **Balance WeakAura Packs**

The following links lead to various balance druid WeakAura packs. These contain everything that's recommended to track to play at a high level. None of these are particular better or more useful than others, and which one you should use is up to your personal preference.

- [Shrom's Ultimate AP Bar](https://wago.io/GzpP7i8ic)
- [Genesis DF Balance Druid](https://wago.io/1HX3XwarK)
- [Oi Balance pack](https://wago.io/OiBalance)

### **Casts until you can cast Starfire**

[Starfire Alerter](https://wago.io/rrtAyRQjF)
See the description of the WA for more details. This is not a required WA but will make it easier to not get into situations where you are wasting a Starfire cast inside Solar Eclipse.

<br><div id="cancel">

## [Cancelaura Macros](#cancel)

</div>

### **Cancelling Pulsar**

**As of 10.1.5 and forward this no longer represents a relevant gain with the change to Radiant Moonlight increasing the cooldown of Fury of Elune by 5 seconds.**

### **Cancelling Starlord**

**With baseline changes and new set in 10.2, cancelling your Starlord aura is back to being insignificant [(~0.2%)](#sims).**

If you want to engage in this entirely optional method without incurring a dps loss, you should aim to cancel Starlord at any point in an Eclipse window where the buff is currently at less than two seconds, and you are about to use {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} to prevent overcapping.
