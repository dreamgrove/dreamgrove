[M+ build](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQEFAUQcCQhUUUxVQQBBNUYlUUGYVVECQQCUA) - this is if you are forced to play beam




DRUID TREE DEVIATIONS:

- ALWAYS hit Nature’s Vigil in raid and M+ unless the content is a joke.
- IF you are pure ST and do not need any other utility, you can hit Nature Recovery and Thick Hide, while getting everything else other than Astral Influence:
https://www.wowhead.com/beta/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQFFQVQcCYBQUExRQQBBAA
- If you have to pick utility, or want any other point than the build above, start by cutting the resto parts of the tree like in the example below: 
https://www.wowhead.com/beta/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQEFAUQcCQhQUUxRQQBBAA
- From this point onwards, you can pick either Feline Swiftness, another point in WHI, 1minute roar, typhoon and so on. 
- If you want more points, to cut the least defensive from your build you would have to cut Renewal if only one point was needed, if two points are needed, cut Incap roar and WHI and if you want more than that swap spec. 
- If you need Decurse inside of an m+ dungeon, use the following build:
https://www.wowhead.com/beta/talent-calc/druid/balance/DAQFFQVQcCQhQUUxQQQBBNUYlUUGYVVECQQCUA

## [Food?](#food)

</div>


[Grand Banquet of the Kalu'ak](https://www.wowhead.com/item=197794/grand-banquet-of-the-kaluak) in every situation, [Sizzling Seafood Medley](https://www.wowhead.com/item=197784/sizzling-seafood-medley) is a cheaper close contender. 


<div id="phials">

## [Phials?](#Phials)

</div>

**ST**

Pure damage wise with 100% uptime on all of the Phials and not counting in the downsides their hierarchy is as follows on Single Target:

[Phial of Static Empowerment](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=191338/phial-of-static-empowerment)
[Phial of Charged Isolation](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=191332/phial-of-charged-isolation)

## [Stat Priority:](#stats)

</div>

Sim yourself using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). Do not follow any stat priorities.



<div id="embellishments">

## [Embellishments](#embellishments)

</div>

**ST:**
The best embellishments raw damage wise at full uptime are [Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375323/elemental-lariat) and [Bronzed Grip Wrappings](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396442/bronzed-grip-wrappings). 
A close contender is [Blue Silken Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=387335/blue-silken-lining) at full uptime, which should in my opinion not be considered on pure ST.
[Potion Absorption Inhibitor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371700/potion-absorption-inhibitor) and [Thriving Thorns](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=379396/thriving-thorns) are the next two best options, so I would recommend one of these two.

**AOE:**
The best embellishments raw damage wise, at full uptime are [Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375323/elemental-lariat) and [Blue Silken Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=387335/blue-silken-lining). 
A close contender is [Potion Absorption Inhibitor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371700/potion-absorption-inhibitor), so I would recommend just sticking with this and [Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375323/elemental-lariat) for anything AOE, unless you are reclearing an easy fight.
[Potion Absorption Inhibitor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371700/potion-absorption-inhibitor)

**TLDR:** 
[Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375323/elemental-lariat) (always use) > [Bronzed Grip Wrappings](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396442/bronzed-grip-wrappings) (ST) = [Potion Absorption Inhibitor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371700/potion-absorption-inhibitor) (AoE) > [Blue Silken Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=387335/blue-silken-lining) (controlled environment)


<div id="tier-set">

## [Tier Set?](#tier-set)

2PC: 2% DPS ST, 2.5% AoE 
4PC: 12% DPS ST, 12.5% AoE
TLDR: Loot or bench

How to use the 4PC procs can be found in the #Rotation section. (Starsurge ST, Starfall AoE)

## [Trinkets](#trinkets)

<div id="gearing-advice">

## [Gearing Advice](#gearing-advice)

</div>

In general try to hit Ilvl > Mastery gear. If it has mastery it is most likely good, it does NOT need haste or anything else. For stuff that does not have mastery just sim in between dungeons.

**Dungeons to Spam:**

Nokund Offensive - In general insane loot, really good trinket, a lot of mastery gear. If you are pugging keys and are able to target, try to soft spam this dungeon.
Halls of Valor - This dungeon is really heavy on mastery gear and the trinkets are also pretty good. Do not reroll this dungeon.
Algeth'Ar Academy - Good for weapon hunting, it has a low drop pool so you can get it relatively fast
Court of Stars - Although the loot pool is diluted, Signet of Melandrus is around 400 agility for Feral if you will at all play that. Infernal Writ is also a really solid trinket. 
Temple of the Jade Serpent - Although the loot pool is diluted, there are some decent pieces and a really good mainhand. Do not go out of your way to spam this, but do not reroll this either.

**Dungeons to Reroll:**

Shadowmoon Burial Grounds - Unless the Loot table gets purged a lot on live, try to reroll this dungeon, as you can not target most of the loot and mainstat jewelry is worse than normal one.
Ruby Life Pools - Good for weapon if you do not have one yet, otherwise skip unless someone in your group needs this or you need score
Azure Vault - Mostly garbage loot, skip unless someone in your group needs this or you need score



<div id="misc">

# [6. Miscellaneous:](#misc)

</div>


<div id="snapshot">

## [Do our dots snapshot?](#snapshot)

</div>

No, all of our periodic damage (like {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}, {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}}, {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare " >}}) does NOT snapshot, everything is dynamic. That means any dots gain/lose the mastery bonus upon entering/leaving the Eclipse that buffs them and whenever any other stat/damage increases are applied/expire.








<div id="owlkin-frenzy">

## [How do I use Owlkin Frenzy procs?](#owlkin-frenzy)

</div>

When Lunar Eclipse is active use {{< spell 157228 "Owlkin Frenzy" >}} procs as soon as possible. When ONLY Solar Eclipse is active, use it when fighting 3+ targets or when you need to move. Otherwise let it expire.





<div id="astral-damage">
 
## [What is Astral damage?](#astral-damage)

</div>

Astral damage is Arcane and Nature damage at the same time meaning that these spells benefit from effects that buff either spell school and double dip whenever effects that buff both are active. Mind that class buffs only affect class spells so if a trinket does nature or arcane damage they are not affected by our buffs to these spell classes.


<div id="macros">

## [Macros](#macros)

**TBD**


<div id="Utility">

# [7. Utility:](#Utility)

{{< spell 3025 "Cat Form" >}} - Stance, 30% movement speed, going into or out of cat form removes slows and roots.

{{< spell 783 "Travel Form" >}} - Stance, 40% movement speed while in combat, 100% movement speed while out of combat, going into or out of travel form removes slows and roots. Keep note which fights/areas you can use this on as it’s a flat better version of Cat Form outside Dash.

{{< spell 5487 "Bear Form" >}} - Stance, 25% stamina 220% armor, stamina can be used to tank mechanics since you will be losing a smaller % of hp inside it leaving you with higher hp when you go out of it. Going into or out of bear form removes slows and roots.

{{< spell 78675 "Solar Beam" >}} - ST interrupt on main target with 5s lockout that places an AoE silence ring on the ground that lasts 8s. The silence ring does not work on some mobs but the actual interrupt does, be careful with this.
