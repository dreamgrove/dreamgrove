<b>Notes</b>

On heroic, Zul is largely a mass AoE fight. You focus adds in a particular order (Caster>Tank Add>Crawgs) but can keep all targets DoTed and Starfall them down for most of Phase 1. Use Tiger Dash to move to soak locations quickly in P1 and P2. Knockbacks, roots, and stuns, can be used on the casters and the crawgs. If your group has strong AoE, you can focus on boss damage and priority damage, as the adds are low health for the most part.

Run Starlord if you're capable of utilizing it well.

<b>Notes</b>

Not much changes on Zul besides the revival type affects on mobs without the Decaying Flesh buff. For this reason it is important you do not use unnecessary AoE and focus mostly on boss damage, only AoEing the mobs at the correct time. Try to refresh your dots before new adds arrive at the boss as to lessen the useless padding damage and pool astral power for AoEing at the correct time. Treants can be used to tank the crawgs and give your tank a breather.

Run Starlord if you're capable of utilizing it well.
