## Heroic
 
{{< talents spec="balance" patch="8.1" recommend="322,232,223,222,123,133,232" >}}

<b>Notes</b>
 
A single target fight that spawns a high priorty add that needs to be cleaved down periodically throughout the fight. There is guaranteed downtime on Vectis through the mechanics of the fight, making Incarnation and Fury of Elune more powerful than usual. Renewal is useful due to the low movement of this fight and for topping yourself off before Contagion.

<b>Notes</b>

Not much changes from heroic, but the damage is much more intense and priority add damage gains a lot of value due to that fact. Try to sync Fury of Elune with add spawns and watch your dot uptime so that you can refresh them within pandemic while also hitting the adds with the dot. Restoration Affinity becomes very powerful on mythic as the healing throughput required for this fight is very high and be used to off heal during intermission.
