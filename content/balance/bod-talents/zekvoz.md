<b>Notes</b>

A three phase fight split into burst add cleave, split priority target focus, and finally a single target burn. 
We recommend Incarnation for bursting down the add spawns and for the final phase single target burn. 
Solar Beam and Mighty Bash work on the P2 caster minions and Typhoon can knock back the melee adds in P1. 
Sort out which of these abilities will best help your raid by speaking with your Raid Leader. Twins Moons is recommended if you need add damage, Stellar Flare otherwise for boss damage.

<b>Notes</b>

In mythic, the three casters and warriors spawn together, so add damage is much more urgent. Depending on how much add damage you need you should use Incarnation on pull, 2nd set of adds, and when you can get your damage buff or with lust. Or you can Incarnation on the 1st set of adds, 3rd set of adds, and with the damage buff or lust. The Roiling Deceit debuff is applied more frequently and ticks hard, potentially overlapping with other damage effects like Eye Beam and Surging Darkness, make sure you use Bear Form and Barkskin for these situations, or even call for externals. Typhoon for the warrior adds and Solar Beam for the casters during Surging Darkness overlaps can easily save the raid and should be used if needed. Twins Moons is recommended if you need add damage, Stellar Flare otherwise for boss damage.
