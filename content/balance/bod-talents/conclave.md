<b>Notes</b>
 
Conclave of the Chosen is primarily a single target focused fights with intermittent add spawns and periods of heavy movement and damage. Be sure to be positioned to fully DoT up all adds that spawn in opposite sections of the room and use either Mighty Bash or Typhoon to slow their movement towards their target. Be careful knocking them too close to each other as it will buff the adds. Watch your raid frames as their is a curse debuff in which we can dispel that will periodically be applied to allies in which they can receive no healing.

<b>Notes</b>

This fight really just comes down to push timing. It is not worth actively trying to multi DoT the bosses for Shooting Stars. Pool Astral Power as to swap to raptors and burst them down after multi dotting ones that won’t instantly die. Mighty Bash and Typhoon are both very useful for keeping the raptors from killing people. Save Barkskin for Paku’s Wrath. Dispelling people and yourself when healing is needed (Along with a Swiftmend if needed), especially when Paku’s Wrath is going to happen.
