<b>Notes</b>

Taloc is primarily a single target fight with some minor add focus and medium movement. Use 
Tiger Dash or Wild Charge to place your Plasmic Discharge in appropriate places.

Starlord is competitive with Incarnation.

## Mythic
{{< talents spec="balance" patch="8.1" recommend="323,213,223,222,133,123,312" >}}
<center>
<b>Notes</b>

Not much changes in mythic, Wild Charge gains some value due to the need for spreading (which slows you) and stacking throughout the fight. 

Starlord is competitive with Incarnation.
