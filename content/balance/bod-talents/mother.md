## Heroic
{{< talents spec="balance" patch="8.1" recommend="223,213,223,313,123,123,321" >}}
<center>
<b>Notes</b>

A fight with huge periods of downtime due to the winds mechanic. The normal single target talents should be ran here, with heavy pooling before the winds come out. If you're having trouble with winds you can take Warrior of Elune.

<b>Notes</b>

Not much changes on mythic for us, the add spawns are a bit more important to kill fast and the lasers throughout the fight come in pairs.
