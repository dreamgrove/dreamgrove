## Introduction

Welcome to the Dreamgrove.gg Balance Druid guide. This guide will explain the basics of Moonkin and teach you the essential information needed to learn it. We hope our guide is immensely helpful and if you have any questions or suggestions, be sure to message us in the Dreamgrove!

Balance is a builder/spender specialization that also harnesses the power of damage over time (DoT) abilities. To put it simply, Balance Druid casts its core abilities to build the resource Astral Power, in which it uses that resource to cast more powerful spenders. 


## Core Abilities

Solar Wrath (SW) - Shoots a ball of Nature energy to deal damage and generate 8 Astral Power.
Lunar Strike (LS) - Calls down a beam of Arcane energy to deal damage to the target and nearby enemies, generating 12 Astral Power.
Moonfire (MF) - Strikes the target with a beam of Arcane damage, leaving a damage over time effect on the target, generates 3 Astral Power.
Sunfire (SF) - Strikes the target with a beam of Nature damage, leaving a damage over time effect on the target and surrounding targets, generates 3 Astral Power
Starsurge (SS) - At the cost of 40 Astral Power, you throw a powerful surge of Astral damage, granting you a Lunar and Solar Empowerment.
Starfall (SF) - At the cost of 50 Astral Power, you call down stars over the targeted area, hitting all enemies in the area.
Empowerments (emp) - Increases the power of Solar Wrath and Lunar Strike based on mastery, generated through Starsurge and Solar Wrath or Lunar Strike.


## Strengths and Weaknesses

Balance Druid brings many strengths, but also suffers from weaknesses like any specialization. It is important that you understand these if you wish to get the most out of Moonkin. 

### Strengths:

Defensives - Barkskin is a decent defensive with a short cooldown that lines up with many abilities. When paired with Bear Form, another strong defensive, becomes a powerful cooldown that can help you survive incredible amounts of damage. Additionally, you have the go-to raiding talent, Guardian Affinity, which offers another a passive 6% damage reduction and a modest 24% heal through frenzied regeneration.

Utility - Moonkin offers strong utility through the three choices of Typhoon, Mass Entanglement and Mighty Bash. These talents granting us impressive crowd control, allow us to displace enemies into more favorable positions for the raid group, root entire groups of mobs to trivialize a mechanic, or stun a priority target respectively. Talenting Force of Nature also provides an underrated tank cooldown which gives the tank time to reestablish their defensives. Baseline, we bring Innervate, Entangling Roots, Soothe, and Hibernate. Innervate is a progression cooldown in which your healer can cast any healing spell for free for 12 seconds. This is useful for long and or high damage fights. Entangling Roots, Soothe, and Hibernate all have the potential to make certain mechanics of a fight insignificant. Another notable part of our utility is Solarbeam. Whenever Solarbeam is able to completely silence an enemy, it tends to be highly valuable.

Priority Damage - If planned accordingly, Balance has capable priority damage, being able to pool resources to quickly burst down a target with Starsurges and through those, Empowerments. Talenting Warrior of Elune and Fury of Elune further strengthens our already potent priority damage, making us high tier in this regard.

Sustained Multi-Target - Outside of cooldowns, Moonkin brings good sustained damage on multiple targets. We bring sustained multi-target through our DoTs and Starfall, giving us consistent damage once Sunfire and Moonfire are up and running and we can start generating Astral Power to lay blankets of Starfalls. This is the strength we’re known for and we are nearly unmatched in that aspect.

### Weaknesses:

Weak Cooldowns - Celestial Alignment is one of the weakest cooldowns in the entire game in comparison to other classes. Offering very little for a 3 minute cooldown, you would see very little difference in your overall damage if you didn’t use it at all.

Limited Cleave Range - A majority of our abilities can only strike multiple targets within an 8 yard radius, those abilities being Sunfire, Empowered Solar Wrath, Lunar Strike, and Fury of Elune. Similarly Starfall can only strike targets within a 30 yard radius, potentially losing a portion of our damage if targets in a fight are too spread out.

Long Ramp Time - Moonkin requires a long amount of time to get its damage going compared to other classes. In multi-target situations you must DoT every target and in single target situations, you must build up enough Astral Power to start firing out Starsurges and Empowerments.

Mobility While Casting - Being a caster, it is imperative you are prepared for movement and deal with mechanics while also dealing damage, but Balance has huge problems achieving that. With our slow Astral Power generation it can be difficult to have enough resources to be able to Starsurge out of a mechanic. 

## Talents

Currently Moonkin’s talents are generally extremely close in power overall, but it is still important that you choose the correct talents for the encounter if you wish to thrive as Balance. Understanding a talents’ strong suit is the key to playing optimally..

### Tier 15:

Nature’s Balance (NB): Generates 2 Astral Power every 3 seconds and also makes your base Astral Power out of combat 50 rather than 0. Decent for sustained multi-target giving us constantly generating Astral Power. This talent, albeit niche, has the potential to be advantageous in Mythic+, notably those with long spans of downtime, giving the talent time to recharge your Astral Power to 50. Meaning it is also great in open world content as you’re regularly walking from place to place.

Warrior of Elune (WoE): On activation, causes your next 3 Lunar Strikes to be instant cast and award 40% more astral power. This talent grants useful burst and priority target damage. Warrior of Elune is the best in the Tier 15 row for dealing with high movement encounters, generating 3 GCDs (Global Cooldowns) of movement and enough Astral Power for a spender. The three free Lunar Strikes should be used back to back regardless of if they’re empowered or not unless you’d overcap Astral Power.

Force of Nature (FoN): Summons 3 treants to taunt enemies in an area and deal damage. Being the best on pure single target Patchwerk fights, these treants should be used on cooldown. Their real strength comes in the form of Mythic+ utility, giving the tank breathing room against hard hitting mobs and is notably useful on Raging and Necrotic weeks. They are also strong for open world, allowing you to pull huge packs of enemies and effortlessly AoE them down.

### Tier 30:

Wild Charge (WC): The general choice in the row, we can use this ability to great effect in getting around the encounter. Having a very short cooldown, you can use Wild Charge to deal with most mechanics, meaning Wild Charge overshadows its competitors most of the time.

Tiger Dash (TD): Shapeshifts you into Cat Form, boosting your movement speed by 200% and gradually reducing overtime. Tiger Dash can be used for open world questing, otherwise TD is very niche for fights where you need to cover large distances very quickly in which Wild Charge wouldn’t do the trick. 

Renewal: 90 second cooldown in which you heal for 30% of your maximum health. A decent choice if the other two options offer very little in comparison, such as a Patchwerk fight.

### Tier 45:

Feral Affinity: Besides nearly useless Feral abilities, Feral Affinity gives you 15% movement speed, which is only useful if the other two options are completely worthless.

Guardian Affinity: As said before, Guardian Affinity talent is the go-to for most situations, granting generous survivability through the 6% damage reduction and decent healing through Frenzied Regeneration.

Restoration Affinity: Heals you for 3% of your maximum health every 5 seconds and allows you to access healing abilities such as Rejuvenation, Swiftmend, and Wild Growth. This can be a wise talent to take in open world to keep your health topped off.

### Tier 60:

Mighty Bash: A single target 5 second stun. Generally not very substantial, but when it is, it’s a strong talent.

Mass Entanglement: Roots a target and surrounding enemies around the target for 30 seconds. It can be incredibly powerful if it is used to cheese certain fights. Otherwise other talents will generally see much more use.

Typhoon: Knocks enemies in front of you away and slows them. Being the default choice of the row, Typhoon has the most uses. Its kiting ability has proven to be invaluable in open world and certain encounters.

### Tier 75: 

Soul of the Forest (SotF): Reduces the cost of Starfall by 10 Astral Power and grants Empowerments a 30% multiplicative scaling. The best in the row when it comes to sustained multi-target, making your Empowerments hit harder and saving you Astral Power to throw more starfalls out.

Starlord (SL): Causes your spenders to award a stack of 3% haste, stacking up to 3 times and not refreshing the duration with a new stack. Offering the best low target damage and great multi-target, this talent can be utilized to its fullest by not spending any Astral Power in the last 5 seconds of the buff. Starlord isn’t heavily impacted by kill time like incarnation is, but suffers more in heavy movement.

Incarnation: Chosen of Elune (Incarn): This talent replaces Celestial Alignment as our 3 minute cooldown enhancing our damage cooldown with longer duration and more % damage gain. Incarn can be very potent in situations where large burst is required. Otherwise it falls behind the other options in raw output and is massively impacted by kill time. If you are mostly spamming Sunfire or Moonfire (due to Azerite traits), Incarn gains a lot of value, becoming the best talent in the row (explained later in the guide).

### Tier 90: 

Stellar Drift (SD): Allows you to freely move within Starfall’s radius and increases Starfalls damage, Stellar Drift is sadly outclassed by Twin Moons outside of niche situations

Twin Moons (TM): Causes your Moonfire to spread to one extra target. Twin Moons is generally the best on most raid bosses and in dungeons as it is nearly the highest damage on single target and is amazing for multi-target due to raw throughput and reducing our ramp time significantly.

Stellar Flare (StFl): A third DoT and the top single target option by a small margin, this spell falls off with any new targets being introduced. But, it can be decent if there are a low amount of spread targets.

### Tier 100: 

Shooting Stars (ShS): Moonfire and Sunfire have a chance to generate a shooting star which damages the enemy and grants you 4 Astral Power. This ability is the best pure single target and two target option. There is a hidden diminishing return attached to Shooting Stars which is why it loses value with more targets unless they are spread.

Fury of Elune (FoE): Our ultimate burst ability, awarding unmatched burst in a short 1 minute cooldown in the form of a tremendous laser which cleaves every target in an 8 yard radius. Any time there is 3+ targets Fury of Elune will tend to be the best option unless the targets aren’t stacked. In addition to doing a lot of damage, FoE grants you 40 Astral Power which can keep the burst going, generally making spell the go-to for heavy burst as well.

New Moon (Moons): An ability which cycles through 3 types of moons that increase in power, cast time, and Astral Power Generation. The weakest option in the row, Moons lack any real niche and just aren’t worth taking in any situation.



### General Single Target Build:

### General AoE Build:


## Rotation / Priority List	

Balance doesn’t follow a strict rotation, it’s more of a priority list.

### Opener

2.5 seconds before the pull cast two Solar Wraths standing away from the boss. As soon as the timer hits 0 and the boss is pulled apply Sunfire, Moonfire, and if talented, Stellar Flare. At this point spam Solar wrath until you reach at least 40 Astral Power and activate Celestial Alignment/Incarnation: Chosen of Elune.

	Wrath > Wrath > DoT > DoT > (Stellar Flare*) > Wrath until 40 > Cooldowns > (FoE* and FoN*) > Rotation

### Single Target and Two Targets

1. Maintain 100% uptime on Moonfire, Sunfire, and Stellar Flare if talented. Make sure you only refresh DoTs when they’re within pandemic range (30% of the original DoT, this is 6.6 seconds for Moonfire, 5.4 seconds for Sunfire, and 7.2 seconds for Stellar Flare.)

2. Avoid capping Astral Power by casting Starsurge

3. Spend Solar and Lunar Empowerments. It is important you don’t cap Empowerments unless you would otherwise cap Astral Power. If you must waste one of the two, the Lunar Empowerment is worth more and you should waste a Solar Empowerment.

4. When you have no DoTs to apply and no Empowerments to spend, you should fill with Solar Wrath. If you’re able to hit even one extra target, you should instead fill with Lunar Strike.

### Multi-Target

1. Maintain 100% uptime on Moonfire and Sunfire. Make sure you only refresh DoTs when they’re within pandemic range.

2. Use Astral Power on Starfall if you can hit at least 3 targets with it, otherwise spend your Astral Power on Starsurge.

3. Spend any Solar or Lunar Empowerments you gain from casting fillers.

4. When you have no DoTs to apply and no Empowerments to spend, you should fill with Solar Wrath. If you’re able to hit at least 3 targets, you should instead fill with Lunar Strike.

Rotation With 2-3 Power of the Moon Traits

If you have 2 Power of the Moon traits it is important to understand the rotation changes on 2 targets, instead filling with Moonfire and not casting Empowerments. With 3 traits, Moonfire spam becomes best on 2-3 targets.

1. Maintain 100% uptime on Moonfire and Sunfire. Make sure you only refresh DoTs when they’re within pandemic range.

2. Avoid overcapping Astral Power by casting Starsurge on 2 targets and Starfall on 3 targets.

3. Fill with Moonfire.

### Rotation With 3 High Noon Traits

Much like Power of the Moon, having 3 High Noon traits makes it worth mostly spamming a single ability, Sunfire being that ability, and only if you are attacking a single target. In this situation you should follow a similar priority:

1. Maintain 100% uptime on Moonfire and Sunfire. Make sure you only refresh DoTs when they’re within pandemic range.

2. Avoid overcapping Astral Power by casting Starsurge.

3. Fill with Sunfire


## Gearing and Simulations

It is heavily recommended you sim your character regardless of what guides say as that is almost always the best way to know if something is an upgrade.

Intellect is your primary stat, it will be on almost all of your gear besides jewelry and some trinkets, usually you don’t want to sacrifice too much item level for secondaries stats. Otherwise your secondary stat priority will usually look something like so: 


Haste > Crit >= Vers > Mastery

Notable trinkets you should consider are the following: 

Rotcrusted Voodoo Doll and Lady Waycrest’s Music Box for single target
Ignition Mage’s Fuse and Conch of Dark Whispers for multi-target.
Azurethos’ Singed Plumage and Drust-Runed Icicle are strong overall.

Once trinket simulations are more concrete, a trinket spreadsheet will be added here to give a more full rough estimate of useful trinkets you should look out for. Until then it is recommended you sim all trinkets you think may be upgrades and hold onto those. These listed trinkets are not always going to be upgrades for your own character.


## Azerite Traits

Like other gear, Azerite gear should be simmed, just because a piece of gear has your best trait doesn’t mean it is an upgrade. Use logic when choosing between Azerite pieces as well, just because a trait sims less doesn’t mean it is worse if it gives more burst for example. When choosing between defensive vs. offensive Azerite, weigh how important survivability is and if it is needed. This can not be properly explained in a guide as these situations are much too specific.

### Balance Druid Traits 

Dawning Sun - Lunar Strikes increases the damage of all Solar Wraths within the next 8 seconds. Overall, a mediocre trait that doesn’t affect your damage very much.

Sunblaze - Causes Solar Wrath to increase the damage of Starsurge. Much like Dawning Sun, Sunblaze doesn’t do very much for your damage and even worse, not scaling with more targets. It could be useful if you need constant single target burst, but that is very niche and is rarely worth using if you have a choice.

Streaking Stars - During Celestial Alignment, every non repeated spell inflicts bonus damage upon the target. Our premier single target Azerite trait, allowing for crazy burst during cooldowns. It is important to note this trait does not work with spells such as Starfall and does not gain more power from Incarnation: Chosen of Elune as the damage of Streaking Stars is reduced when talented into it. 

Lunar Shrapnel - Enemies with Moonfire applied who are hit by Starfall pulse damage to themselves and enemies around them. The go-to trait for sustained multi-target, Lunar Shrapnel provides excellent damage on stacked mobs, but at the loss of single target damage.

Power of the Moon - The direct damage of Moonfire does additional damage and has a 5% chance to generate a Lunar Empowerment. This is the dominant trait in 2 or 3 target fights, due to making Moonfire so powerful that you should spam it anytime there is an appropriate amount of targets. For more information on Moonfire spam, look in the Rotation section.

High Noon - The direct and DoT effect of Sunfire is increased and Sunfire gains a 3 yard radius increase. Similar to Power of the Moon, High Noon has the possibility of making you spam Sunfire on a single target, resulting in no loss of damage through movement and doing more damage than Streaking Stars. For more information on Sunfire spam, look in the Rotation section.

### Notable General/Non-Balance Specific Azerite Traits

Laser Matrix - Laser Matrix Causes your spells and abilities to shoot a blast of lasers, dealing split damage and healing friendly targets.  Being comparable to Streaking Stars in damage and also healing your raid. It is safe to say this trait is going to be highly desired as it also actives Reorigination Array, a passive buff in Uldir giving you a huge amount of your most plentiful secondary stat based on how many bosses in Uldir you have slain.  

Lively Spirit - Awards you with an impressive amount of intellect based on how many spells the healer you Innervated casts, lasting 20 seconds. Albeit more complicated to pull off, Lively Spirit has a reward for using it correctly. That is being nearly equal to Streaking Stars on single target, and scaling well in multi-target situations, granting absurd burst damage.


## Mythic+ 

This section of the guide will explain the basics of Mythic+ as a Balance Druid. Moonkin brings a lot to the table in Mythic+ and is a viable caster at all levels of keys. Our main strengths come from sustained multi-target, a plethora of utility, consistent defensives, and very little loss of single target damage from talenting full AoE compared to other dps. 

### Talents 

The generic talents you would take in Mythic+ are: 
(FoN/WC/Guardian Affinity/Typhoon/SotF/TM/FoE)

Notable Alternative Talents and When to Use Them

Tier 15: 

Nature’s Balance can be the strongest throughput of the entire row if the dungeon has a high amount of downtime in between packs and bosses so that you can benefit from the recharge out of combat.

Warrior of Elune is the general damage talent when you don’t need treants as it offers ample burst on demand and can help deal with heavy movement.

Tier 45:

Restoration Affinity is potentially very helpful in certain dungeons as sometimes it can be difficult for your healer to keep the group alive. Even though it will cost you some damage, a quick Swiftmend can easily save someone's life. Likewise, a group wide Wild Growth can give the healer a bit more time to deal with incoming damage.

Tier 60:

Mighty Bash can come in handy when there are extremely dangerous mobs that aren’t affected by knockbacks and need to be dealt with.

Tier 75: 

Starlord can be a viable choice in a low mob count dungeon. If taking this talent, no Astral Power should be spent within the last 5 seconds of the Starlord buff and pooling Astral Power is of more importance than usual as quickly gaining 2 stacks of Starlord is very solid in terms of damage.

Tier 90:

Stellar Drift could potentially be worth taking if the dungeon has low trash density and a very high amount of movement.

Tier 100: 

Shooting Stars can be taken over FoE in dungeons where there are many spread out adds.

### Utility

As a Balance Druid it is vital you capitalize on your very useful utility. Typhoon and FoN will make you the tanks best friend, assisting them in moving mobs out of Sanguine or other mechanics, and helping them kite or stay alive in general. Dispelling enrage effects with Soothe will keep your tank and groups health much more stable and Hibernate can even be used to completely take a mob and therefore a mechanic out of the fight, making everyone's lives much easier.

### Azerite Traits

In Battle for Azeroth, the gear you have equipped once the key begins is the gear you will have throughout the entire dungeon, so it is crucial you prepare accordingly and choose the best Azerite pieces for the job. Currently there are 3 Azerite traits that stick out in Mythic+.

Lunar Shrapnel - This will be the general go-to Azerite in pugs and high density dungeons, being easy to use and effective, requiring little communication to pull off. Lunar Shrapnel will leave your single target something to be desired, but it’s worth it for the massive payoff.

Lively Spirit - Lively Spirit can be highly effective in a cohesive group. Being one of our strongest single targets and multi-target traits. With good communication and planning you can use Lively Spirit to deal ludicrous burst damage.

Power of the Moon - A more niche option, offering quick constant burst for affixes like Explosive. Possibly Power of the Moon could be powerful in dungeons where there are little amounts of trash and/or even bosses that include 2 target cleave..   


## Mastering Moonkin

Once you have gotten the basics down, you may wish to improve further with Moonkin. First off, the most important step to becoming a good player and specifically Balance Druid, is playing the spec and getting experience. Besides experience, which is essential, we have listed the general tips that should prove helpful in fully understanding even the most specific points of the specialization.

### Effectively Using Cooldowns

Generally the best way to use your cooldowns is by casting them as soon as they’re up, but it can sometimes be more beneficial to your raid or to your damage to hold them. Examples of when you would hold your cooldown is if a high priority target that needs to die fast is spawning in 30 seconds and you need all the damage you can get or if that target will take extra damage.

### Dealing with Movement

The biggest loss of damage comes from lack of planning and incurring downtime, that goes for every caster. To combat movement you should fully understand a fight before even starting it, and watch timers throughout the fight, being ready for the mechanics. 

Say you have 40 Astral Power, no Empowerments, and the boss will use an ability that will force you to move in 3 seconds. Instead of using a Starsurge, it is better to instead cast 2 unempowered Solar Wraths and step out of the mechanic with a Starsurge. This will result in you saving a whole gcd of damage you would have otherwise lost to casting Sunfire/Moonfire. Throughout an entire fight these gcds will add up and it is paramount you get that idea down. 

### Taking Advantage of Forced Downtime

There will be times where mistakes are made regardless of your skill and times where you are forced into downtime no matter what is done, so you should make the most it. Make sure if you have to use Bear Form to survive a mechanic you are casting Moonfire during downtime and squeezing out some form of damage.

During fights like Vectis (or Imonar) you will absolutely have forced downtime and this is out of your control, but the talents you take are not. Talents like Shooting Stars or Starlord might be the best for you according to sims, but due to the nature of a fight like Vectis you can’t escape losing some value of these passive abilities. Something like Incarn or Fury of Elune would be better suited here as they are only slightly worse in raw damage, but award you some value even during complete downtime as the cooldown will still be ticking.

### Pooling for Predictable Adds

Fights akin to Mythrax (or Portal Keeper) present you with obvious priority adds and multi-target that you can definitely plan ahead for. Depending on where you are needed more, before the boss spawns these adds you could pool nearly full Astral Power and burst those adds so that they will die as fast as possible. Especially on progression this is vital in being useful to the raid as the longer the raid has to deal with those adds, the higher your chance of wiping.
