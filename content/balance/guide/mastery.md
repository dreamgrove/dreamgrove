Once you have gotten the basics down, you may wish to improve further with Moonkin. First off, the most important step to becoming a good player and specifically Balance Druid, is playing the spec and getting experience. Besides experience, which is essential, we have listed the general tips that should prove helpful in fully understanding even the most specific points of the specialization.

### Effectively Using Cooldowns

Generally the best way to use your cooldowns is by casting them as soon as they’re up, but it can sometimes be more beneficial to your raid or to your damage to hold them. Examples of when you would hold your cooldown is if a high priority target that needs to die fast is spawning in 30 seconds and you need all the damage you can get or if that target will take extra damage.

### Dealing with Movement

The biggest loss of damage comes from lack of planning and incurring downtime, that goes for every caster. To combat movement you should fully understand a fight before even starting it, and watch timers throughout the fight, being ready for the mechanics. 

Say you have 40 Astral Power, no {{< spell 279708 "Empowerments" "live" >}}, and the boss will use an ability that will force you to move in 3 seconds. Instead of using a {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "live" >}}, it is better to instead cast 2 unempowered {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wrath" "live" >}}s and step out of the mechanic with a Starsurge. This will result in you saving a whole gcd of damage you would have otherwise lost to casting {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "live" >}}/{{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "live" >}}. Throughout an entire fight these gcds will add up and it is paramount you get that idea down. 

### Taking Advantage of Forced Downtime

There will be times where mistakes are made regardless of your skill and times where you are forced into downtime no matter what is done, so you should make the most it. Make sure if you have to use {{< spell 5487 "Bear Form" "live" >}} to survive a mechanic you are casting Moonfire during downtime and squeezing out some form of damage.

During fights like Vectis (or Imonar) you will absolutely have forced downtime and this is out of your control, but the talents you take are not. Talents like {{< spell 202342 "Shooting Stars" "live" >}} or {{< spell 202345 "Starlord" "live" >}} might be the best for you according to sims, but due to the nature of a fight like Vectis you can’t escape losing some value of these passive abilities. Something like {{< spell 102560 "Incarnation: Chosen of Elune" "live" >}} or {{< spell 202770 "Fury of Elune" "live" >}} would be better suited here as they are only slightly worse in raw damage, but award you some value even during complete downtime as the cooldown will still be ticking.

### Pooling for Predictable Adds

Fights akin to Mythrax (or Portal Keeper) present you with obvious priority adds and multi-target that you can definitely plan ahead for. Depending on where you are needed more, before the boss spawns these adds you could pool nearly full Astral Power and burst those adds so that they will die as fast as possible. Especially on progression this is vital in being useful to the raid as the longer the raid has to deal with those adds, the higher your chance of wiping.
