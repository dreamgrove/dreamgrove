It is heavily recommended you sim your character regardless of what guides say as that is almost always the best way to know if something is an upgrade as your best stats depend completely on your specific character.

Intellect is your primary stat, it will be on almost all of your gear besides jewelry and some trinkets, usually you don’t want to sacrifice too much item level for secondaries stats as it is not worth losing too much intellect. Otherwise your secondary stat priority will usually look something like so: 

- **Haste >= Mastery > Critical Strike > Versatility**

### Enchants:

- {{< spell 300769 "Machinist's Brilliance" >}}
- {{< spell 297989 "Accord of Haste" >}}

### Consumables: 

- {{< item 168652 "Greater Flask of Endless Fathoms" >}}
- {{< item 168506 "Potion of Focused Resolve" >}} on pure single target, {{< item 169299 "Potion of Unbridled Fury" >}} on 2-4 targets, or 1 target with cleave and {{< item 168529 "Potion of Empowered Proximity" >}} on 5+ targets.
- {{< item 168313 "Baked Port Tato" >}}

### Sockets: 

- 1 {{< item 168638 "Leviathan's Eye of Intellect" >}} and the rest of your sockets with {{< item 168641 "Quick Sand Spinel" >}}

### Notable trinkets you should consider are the following: 

- Any trinket that is of high item level. You should sim your trinkets for accuracy.
