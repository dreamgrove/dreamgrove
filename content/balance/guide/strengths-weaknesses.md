Balance Druid brings many strengths, but also suffers from weaknesses like any specialization. It is important that you understand these if you wish to get the most out of Moonkin. 

### Strengths:

High Availability Defensives - {{< spell 22812 "Barkskin" "live" >}} is a decent defensive with a short cooldown that lines up with many mechanics. When paired with {{< spell 5487 "Bear Form" "live" >}}, another decent defensive, this becomes a powerful small cooldown that can help you survive high amounts of damage. Additionally, you have great defensive talents in the tier 45 row. {{< spell 197492 "Restoration Affinity" "live" >}}, which offers a passive 3% health heal every 5 seconds and allows for you to {{< spell 18562 "Swiftmend" "live" >}} yourself or others for ludicrous amounts on a short 25 second cooldown or {{< spell 197491 "Guardian Affinity" "live" >}}, awarding a passive 6% mitigation and decent heal in Bear Form. All of these defensives have only brief cooldowns or even no cooldown.

Utility - Moonkin offers strong utility through the three choices of {{< spell 132469 "Typhoon" "live" >}}, {{< spell 102359 "Mass Entanglement" "live" >}} and {{< spell 5211 "Mighty Bash" "live" >}}. These talents granting us impressive crowd control, allow us to displace enemies into more favorable positions for the raid group, root entire groups of mobs to trivialize a mechanic, or stun a priority target respectively. Talenting {{< spell 205636 "Force of Nature" "live" >}} also provides an underrated defensive cooldown which gives the tank time to reestablish their defensives. Baseline, we bring {{< spell 29166 "Innervate" "live" >}}, {{< spell 339 "Entangling Roots" "live" >}}, {{< spell 2908 "Soothe" "live" >}}, and {{< spell 2637 "Hibernate" "live" >}}. Innervate is a progression cooldown in which your healer can cast any healing spell for free for 12 seconds. This is useful for long and or high damage fights. Entangling Roots, Soothe, and Hibernate all have the potential to make certain mechanics of a fight insignificant. Another notable part of our utility is {{< spell 78675 "Solar Beam" "live" >}}. Whenever Solar Beam is able to completely silence an enemy, it tends to be highly valuable.

Single Target Priority Damage - If planned accordingly, Balance has capable single target priority damage, being able to pool resources to quickly burst down a target with multiple casts of {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "live" >}} and through those, {{< spell 279708 "Empowerments" "live" >}}. Talenting {{< spell 202425 "Warrior of Elune" "live" >}} or {{< spell 205636 "Force of Nature" "live" >}} and {{< spell 202770 "Fury of Elune" "live" >}} further strengthens our already potent priority damage, making us high tier in this regard.

Sustained Spread Multi-Target - Outside of cooldowns, Moonkin brings good sustained damage on multiple spread targets. We bring this through our DoTs and {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" "live" >}}, giving us consistent damage once {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "live" >}} and {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "live" >}} are applied and we can start generating Astral Power to lay blankets of Starfalls. This is the strength we’re known for and we are nearly unmatched in that aspect.

### Weaknesses:

Weak Cooldowns - {{< spell 194223 "Celestial Alignment" "live" >}} is one of the weakest cooldowns in the entire game in comparison to other classes. Offering very little for a 3 minute cooldown, you would see very little difference in your overall damage if you didn’t use it at all.

Long AoE Ramp Time - Moonkin requires a long amount of time to get its damage going compared to other classes. In multi-target situations you must DoT every target and then generate enough Astral Power to start your damage in a meaningful way.

Mobility While Casting - Being a caster, it is imperative you are prepared for movement and deal with mechanics while also dealing damage, but Balance has huge problems achieving that. With our slow Astral Power generation it can be difficult to have enough resources to be able to {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "live" >}} out of a mechanic.

No Immunity - Lacking an immunity can be a massive weakness on certain encounters as they can sometimes allow for a fight's mechanics to be negated. We do however make up for this with decent soaking capabilities due to {{< spell 5487 "Bear Form" "live" >}}.
