Currently Moonkin’s talents are generally extremely close in power overall, but it is still important that you choose the correct talents for the encounter if you wish to thrive as Balance. Understanding a talents’ strong suit is the key to playing optimally.

### Tier 15:
{{< talent-row spec="balance" tier="15" src="live" >}}

{{< spell 202430 "Nature’s Balance" "ptr" >}} (NB): Generates 2 Astral Power every 3 seconds and also makes your base Astral Power out of combat 50 rather than 0. Decent for sustained multi-target giving us constantly generating Astral Power. This talent, albeit niche, has the potential to be advantageous in Mythic+, notably those with long spans of downtime, giving the talent time to recharge your Astral Power to 50 (the out of combat Astral Power generation is greater than the in combat generation). Meaning it is also great in open world content as you’re regularly walking from place to place. Nature's Balance is the go-to talent for pure damage.

{{< spell 202425 "Warrior of Elune" "ptr" >}} (WoE): On activation, causes your next 3 {{< spell 194153 "Lunar Strikes" "ptr" >}} to be instant cast and award 40% more astral power. This talent grants useful burst and priority target damage. Warrior of Elune is the best in the Tier 15 row for dealing with high movement encounters and for when burst AoE is needed, generating 3 GCDs (Global Cooldowns) of movement and enough Astral Power for a spender. The three free Lunar Strikes should be used in rapid succession regardless of if they're empowered or not, unless you are using the {{< spell 272871 "Streaking Stars" "ptr" >}} trait or you'd overcap Astral Power.

{{< spell 205636 "Force of Nature" "ptr" >}} (FoN): Summons 3 treants to taunt enemies in an area and deal damage. Though the weakest in the row for damage, they bring unmatched utility that makes Moonkin a useful dps to have dungeons. Their real strength comes in the form of Mythic+ utility, giving the tank breathing room against hard hitting mobs and is notably useful on Raging and Necrotic weeks, also for Reaping.  these treants should generally be used on cooldown, unless single target burst is needed or the tank needs them defensively. They are also strong for open world, allowing you to pull huge packs of enemies and effortlessly AoE them down.

### Tier 30:
{{< talent-row spec="balance" tier="30" src="live" >}}

{{< spell 16979 "Wild Charge" "live" >}} (WC): When used, Wild Charge will activate a movement ability based on your current shapeshift form. In {{< spell 5487 "Bear Form" "live" >}} and {{< spell 768 "Cat Form" "live" >}}, this spell will cause you to charge or leap to the target. {{< spell 24858 "Moonkin Form" "live" >}} and {{< spell 783 "Travel Form" "live" >}} will fling you backwards or forwards respectively. Finally, {{< spell 276012 "Aquatic Form" "live" >}} will increase your swim speed and if you lack a shapeshift form, you will fly to a targeted ally. The general choice in the row, we can use this ability to great effect in getting around the encounter. Having a very short cooldown, you should use Wild Charge to deal with most mechanics, generally through Moonkin Form, meaning it overshadows its competitors most of the time.

{{< spell 252216 "Tiger Dash" "live" >}} (TD): Shapeshifts you into {{< spell 768 "Cat Form" "live" >}}, boosting your movement speed by 200% and gradually reducing overtime. Tiger Dash can be used for open world questing, otherwise TD is very niche for fights where you need to cover large distances very quickly in which {{< spell 16979 "Wild Charge" "live" >}} possibly wouldn’t do the trick. Likewise, Tiger Dash can be raid saving on fights in which you have to get out of the raid with a debuff quickly to avoid wiping.

{{< spell 108238 "Renewal" "live" >}}: 90 second cooldown in which you heal for 30% of your maximum health. A decent choice if the other two options offer very little in comparison, such as a Patchwerk fight.

### Tier 45:
{{< talent-row spec="balance" tier="45" src="live" >}}

{{< spell 202157 "Feral Affinity" "live" >}}: Besides nearly useless Feral abilities, Feral Affinity gives you 15% movement speed, which is only useful if the other two options are completely worthless.

{{< spell 197491 "Guardian Affinity" "live" >}}: Guardian Affinity is a decent passive survivability talent, needing no change of play to gain the 6% mitigation. This talent is competitive with Restoration Affinty and much depends on preference and the specific encounter.

{{< spell 197492 "Restoration Affinity" "live" >}}: Heals you for 3% of your maximum health every 5 seconds and allows you to access healing abilities such as Rejuvenation, Swiftmend, and Wild Growth. This is the go-to talent choice in open world or dungeons to keep your allies health topped off. Restoration Affinity is valuable in a raiding environment as Swiftmend can instantly heal someone for 50% of their health, And Ysera's Gift's passive healing can be very useful for high damage fights when your healers can't keep up. Restoration Affinity is competitive with Guardian Affinity in the sense of survivability. Though, if used to its fullest, Resto Affinity tends to be stronger outside of extremely niche situations.

### Tier 60:
{{< talent-row spec="balance" tier="60" src="live" >}}

{{< spell 5211 "Mighty Bash" "live" >}}: A single target 5 second stun. Generally not very substantial, but when it is, it’s a strong talent.

{{< spell 102359 "Mass Entanglement" "live" >}}: Roots a target and surrounding enemies around the target for 30 seconds. It can be incredibly powerful if it is used to cheese certain fights. Otherwise other talents will generally see much more use.

{{< spell 132469 "Typhoon" "live" >}}: Knocks enemies in front of you away and slows them. Being the default choice of the row, Typhoon has the most uses. Its kiting ability has proven to be invaluable in open world and for certain encounters.

### Tier 75:
{{< talent-row spec="balance" tier="75" src="live" >}}

{{< spell 114107 "Soul of the Forest" "live" >}} (SotF): Reduces the cost of {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" "live" >}} by 10 Astral Power and grants {{< spell 279708 "Empowerments" "live" >}} a 30% multiplicative scaling increase. SotF relies quite heavily on Azerite traits and unrealistic scenarios to stand a chance against the competition, requiring {{< spell 278507 "Lunar Shrapnel" "live" >}} (which tends to be on the weaker side) traits to ever be worth using, and even in that case only barely in pure sustained 4+ multi-target, as a lot of single target is lost taking it.

{{< spell 202345 "Starlord" "live" >}} (SL): Causes your spenders to award a stack of 3% haste, stacking up to 3 times and not refreshing the duration with a new stack. Offering the best 1-4 target damage and great multi-target, this talent can be utilized to its fullest by not spending any Astral Power in the last 8 seconds of the buff. Starlord pulls ahead of Incarnation anytime the fight lasts more than roughly two minutes but suffers more in heavy movement, downtime, or when heavy burst is needed. 

{{< spell 102560 "Incarnation: Chosen of Elune" "live" >}} (Incarn): This talent replaces {{< spell 194223 "Celestial Alignment" "live" >}} as our 3 minute cooldown, enhancing our damage cooldown with longer duration and more % damage gain. Incarnation can be very potent in situations where large burst is required, the fight length is short, or the fight has heavy downtime, but still allows you to get your cooldowns off without interruption. Otherwise it falls behind Starlord by a small amount in raw output and is massively impacted by kill time.

### Tier 90: 
{{< talent-row spec="balance" tier="90" src="live" >}}

{{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" "live" >}} (SD): Allows you to freely move within {{< spell 191034 "Starfall’s" "live" >}} radius and increases Starfalls damage, Stellar Drift is sadly outclassed by {{< spell 279620 "Twin Moons" "live" >}} outside of niche situations, though it is the best talent in terms of pure multi-target throughput. Makes Starfall worth casting on 3+ targets.

{{< spell 279620 "Twin Moons" "live" >}} ( TM): Causes your {{< spell 123413 "Moonfire" "live" >}} to spread to one extra target and increases the damage of Moonfire by 10%. Twin Moons shines when a large number of adds must be killed quickly and in dungeons as it is not far behind on single target compared to Stellar Flare and is amazing for multi-target due to raw throughput and reducing our ramp time significantly.

{{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare" "ptr" >}} (StFl): A third DoT and the top single target option by a considerable margin, this spell falls off quite fast with any new targets being introduced. The go to if there are a low amount of spread targets or the fight is mostly single target.

### Tier 100:
{{< talent-row spec="balance" tier="100" src="live" >}}

{{< spell 202342 "Shooting Stars" "live" >}} (ShS): {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "live" >}} and {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "live" >}} have a chance to generate a shooting star which damages the enemy and grants you 4 Astral Power. This ability is the best pure single target and two target option and can be good on many spread targets. There is a hidden diminishing return attached to Shooting Stars which is why it loses value with more targets relative to other talents.

{{< spell 202770 "Fury of Elune" "live" >}} (FoE): Our ultimate burst ability, awarding unmatched burst in a short 1 minute cooldown in the form of a tremendous laser which cleaves every target in an 8 yard radius. Any time there is 3+ targets Fury of Elune will tend to be the best option unless the targets aren’t stacked. In addition to doing a lot of damage, FoE grants you 40 Astral Power which can keep the burst going, generally making the spell the go-to for heavy burst as well.

{{< spell 274281 "New Moon" "live" >}} (Moons): An ability which cycles through 3 types of moons that increase in power, cast time, and Astral Power generation. The weakest option in the row, Moons are very close to Shooting Stars on single target, and can even surpass Shooting Stars with low Haste. Moons could be potentially useful on fights in which there is a short period of time where there are 2 targets and you can Full Moon in that time (while the rest of the fight is mostly single target).
