This section of the guide will explain the basics of Mythic+ as a Balance Druid. Moonkin brings a lot to the table in Mythic+ and is a viable caster at all levels of keys. Our main strengths come from sustained multi-target, a plethora of utility, consistent defensives, and very little loss of single target damage from talenting full AoE compared to other dps. 

### Talents 

The generic talents you would take in Mythic+ are: 

{{< talents spec="balance" src="ptr" recommend="003,003,003,003,003,030,030" >}}

Notable Alternative Talents and When to Use Them

#### Tier 15: 

- {{< spell 202430 "Nature’s Balance" "live" >}} can be taken if you have no need for Treants.

#### Tier 45:

- {{< spell 197491 "Guardian Affinity" "live" >}} could prove useful if it's required to negate a one shot, otherwise {{< spell 197492 "Restoration Affinity" "beta" >}} is generally better.

#### Tier 60:

- {{< spell 5211 "Mighty Bash" "live" >}} can come in handy when there are extremely dangerous singular mobs that aren’t affected by knockbacks and they need to be dealt with.

### Utility

As a Balance Druid it is vital you capitalize on your very useful utility. {{< spell 132469 "Typhoon" "live" >}} and FoN will make you the tanks best friend, assisting them in moving mobs out of Sanguine or other mechanics, and helping them kite or stay alive in general. Dispelling enrage effects (even the Raging affix) with {{< spell 2908 "Soothe" "live" >}} will keep your tank and groups health much more stable and {{< spell 2637 "Hibernate" "live" >}} can even be used to completely take a mob and therefore a mechanic out of the fight, making everyone's lives much easier. {{< spell 78675 "Solar Beam" "live" >}} can completely shut down the threat of an entire group of trash when timed correctly. It’s worth noting a Moonkin also brings a battle rez in the form of {{< spell 20484 "Rebirth" "live" >}} as it is important you have at least one battle rez in a Mythic+ group.

### Azerite Traits

In Battle for Azeroth, the gear you have equipped once the key begins is the gear you will have throughout the entire dungeon, so it is crucial you prepare accordingly and choose the best Azerite pieces for the job. The Azerite traits that you choose should be determined based on your group composition, the dungeon itself, and affixes. You should try to cover the weaknesses of you group as much as possible.

- {{< spell 287773 "Arcanic Pulsar" "ptr" >}} - A single Pulsar trait can be decent just for the powerful low target damage it provides, and can even be prepared before a big pull for impressive burst.

- {{< spell 279646 "Lively Spirit" "ptr" >}} - Though Lively Spirit requires more communication, it can be potent for burst in both single target and multi-target, granting both decent multi-target and single target damage overall unlike most of our considerable Mythic+ traits and easily being our best trait. It is not recommended to use this trait without voice communication. 

- {{< spell 288989 "Treacherous Covenant" >}} - The recommended trait to use if you can't take advantage of Lively Spirit. Covenant is a nice mix of single target and multi-target while also being sustained.

- {{< spell 273389 "Power of the Moon" >}} - a single trait of Power of the Moon is quite powerful for aoe, further traits aren't nearly as useful though.

- Stat Increasing Traits - Generic Stat increasing traits such as {{< spell 280429 "Swirling Sands" "live" >}} or {{< spell 273823 "Blightborne Infusion" "live" >}} can be a decent choice especially if you lack the prior listed traits. These traits much like Lively Spirit act as a mix of single target and multi-target, but don't require communication.

### Trinkets

As it stands there is no trinket that is notably special for Mythic+. That being said, it is recommended you take trinkets that are both strong on multi-target and single target if you have the choice. Simming your character will generally give the best results in figuring out your trinket choice.
