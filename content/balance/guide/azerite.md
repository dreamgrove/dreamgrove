Like other gear, Azerite gear should be simmed, just because a piece of gear has your best trait doesn’t mean it is an upgrade. Use logic when choosing between Azerite pieces as well, just because a trait sims less doesn’t mean it is worse if it gives more burst for example. When choosing between defensive vs. offensive Azerite, weigh how important survivability is and if it is needed. This can not be properly explained in a guide as these situations are much too specific.

### Balance Druid Traits 

- {{< spell 276153 "Dawning Sun" >}} - {{< spell 194153 "Lunar Strike" "ptr" >}} increases the damage of all {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wrath" "ptr" >}}s within the next 8 seconds.

- {{< spell 287773 "Arcanic Pulsar" >}} - Causes every 9th {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" "ptr" >}} to activate {{< spell 194223 "Celestial Alignment" "ptr" >}} or {{< spell 102560 "Incarnation: Chosen of Elune" "ptr" >}} for 6 seconds. Also increases the damage of Starsurge.

- {{< spell 272871 "Streaking Stars" >}} - During {{< spell 194223 "Celestial Alignment" "ptr" >}} or {{< spell 102560 "Incarnation: Chosen of Elune" "ptr" >}} every non repeated spell inflicts bonus damage upon the target once it strikes them.

- {{< spell 278507 "Lunar Shrapnel" >}} - Enemies with {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "ptr" >}} applied who are hit by {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" "ptr" >}} pulse damage to themselves and enemies around them. 

- {{< spell 273389 "Power of the Moon" >}} - The periodic damage of {{< spell 164812 "Moonfire" "ptr" >}} does additional damage and has a chance to generate a Lunar Empowerment (2.5 procs a minute and scaling with haste).

- {{< spell 279070 "High Noon" >}} - The periodic damage of {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" "ptr" >}} is increased and Sunfire gains a 3 yard radius increase. 


### Notable General/Non-Balance Specific Azerite Traits

- {{< spell 280559 "Treacherous Covenant" >}} - Though potentially risky, Treacherous Covenant is an amazing trait on all amounts of targets, providing you with a large chunk of Intellect when above 50% health, but increasing damage taken by 15% when below 20% health.

- {{< spell 279647 "Lively Spirit" >}} - Causes your {{< spell 29166 "Innervate" "ptr" >}} to grant a stack of Intellect for 20 seconds for each spell cast by the healer.


### Stacking Traits

Stacking traits tends to be the way to go as Balance Druid as we don’t lose much value if any from stacking most of our traits. The exceptions are notably {{< spell 287773 "Arcanic Pulsar" >}} and {{< spell 273389 "Power of the Moon" >}}, which only increase the damage effect when adding additional traits. You should simulate these all azerite armor to be sure something is an upgrade as always though.


### Rotation/Talent Changing Traits

- {{< spell 276153 "Dawning Sun" >}} - Slightly alters the rotation by incentivizing you to always have the 8 second buff up before casting {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wrath" "ptr" >}}s, even if the {{< spell 194153 "Lunar Strike" >}} is unempowered.

- {{< spell 272871 "Streaking Stars" >}} - Besides the obvious gameplay change of not repeating the same ability twice in a row, it’s worth noting that you should cast a {{< spell 190984 "Solar Wrath" >}} after every ability (besides Solar Wrath) unless it would cause you to overcap Astral Power or Empowerments (With Incarnation only). 

Keep in mind that while Streaking Stars affects abilities such as {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} and {{< spell 202770 "Fury of Elune" "ptr">}}, it is only the first tick of the ability. Also, this trait has a reduced amount of damage in conjunction with Incarnation: Chosen of Elune (66% of the full damage per proc).

- {{< spell 287773 "Arcanic Pulsar" >}} - Arcanic Pulsar changes your rotation leading up the 9th stack of Arcanic Pulsar, as you should pool accordingly and cast a specific sequence of abilities during the window depending on the distance from your target.


### Top Traits

This is a list of our most potent traits, ones that you should seek out if you can as they dramatically improve a Balance Druids performance in the correct scenario.	

- {{< spell 287773 "Arcanic Pulsar" >}} - Though a 2nd or 3rd Pulsar trait won't vastly improve your character's damage, the first trait will be worth an immense amount on low target encounters, becoming by far our best trait in that situation, and empowering the value of Streaking Stars noticeably.

- {{< spell 272871 "Streaking Stars" >}} - Being one of our top single target traits and offering decent burst, this level of burst can be invaluable in raids especially if there is a period of damage amplification, a target needs to die fast, or the kill time lines up nicely with our cooldowns. Also synergizes nicely with Arcanic Pulsar

- {{< spell 280559 "Laser Matrix" >}} - Laser Matrix is a decent trait on single target and mediocre on multi-target, but also activates Reorigination Array in Uldir. This buff will eventually be awarding us with up to 750 of our highest secondary stat, easily surpassing other traits in damage at this point. You should strive to have at least one of Laser Matrix or Archive of the Titans while in Uldir.

- {{< spell 279647 "Lively Spirit" >}} - Assuming you can achieve a high amount of stacks of Lively Spirit per cast, it is similar to our top traits in power, but comes with the bonus of scaling with multiple targets. Lively Spirit is not for everyone, as it can't be expected for you to be able to use {{< spell 29166 "Innervate" >}} for your own personal damage, but when you can use Lively, it is an exceptional trait, especially in Mythic+.

- {{< spell 273389 "Power of the Moon" >}} and {{< spell 279070 "High Noon" >}} - On encounters with lots of spread targets, these traits could potentially shine, being our most realistic choice for spread multi-target.

- {{< spell 288989 "Treacherous Covenant" >}} - Though potentially risky, the payoff from Treacherous Covenant is large, being nearly as strong as Streaking Stars on single target and scaling with multiple targets.
