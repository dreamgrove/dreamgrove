Hey guys, we decided to help everybody out who is raiding on the pre-patch with a pre-patch specific talent guide! The talent recommendations presented in this guide were made with progression in mind, not number “padding” or farm kills where most of the highest parses come from. Keep in mind that these recommendations are made to maximize the effectiveness of our class, but does not consider YOUR raid group composition. If your raid is full of burst AoE classes that absolutely destroy adds, then you may want to switch to a more single target build to provide more boss damage. This guide provides a general starting point, but adjusting talents to better fit what the raid needs will benefit the raid’s progression the most over stubbornly sticking to the one recommended build.

## Garothi Worldbreaker

### Talents: <br>

{{< talents spec="balance" src="beta" recommend="132,123,231,123,132,123,321" >}}


The only really contested talents are Warrior of Elune vs Force of Nature and Twin Moons vs Stellar Flare. For a fight like Garothi we think Warrior of Elune will give you slightly more mobility in order to be able to dodge the beams and soak the circles on the ground. As for Stellar Flare vs Twin Moons, even though you can cleave the 2 cannons for a bit, it is not better than the .6% that Stellar Flare provides.

## Fel-Hounds

### Talents:

{{< talents spec="balance" src="beta" recommend="132,123,231,123,132,132,321" >}}

As for the talents here, none of them are really questionable. With the recent buffs to Shooting Stars, this talent has increased in DPS by a fair amount. Remember that you are still Starsurging on 2 targets regardless of whether the dogs are stacked or not. If the Dogs will be stacked then you should take Oneth’s Intuition in conjunction with Lady and the Child.

## Anotoran High Command

### Talents:

{{< talents spec="balance" src="beta" recommend="231,123,231,231,231,231,321" >}}

The only real question here is if you would prefer taking Soul of the Forest vs Starlord and Stellar Drift vs Twin Moons. Overall, we do not think that targets will live long enough to warrant the more sustained multi-target options, however if the adds on the encounter are up a long time, then it will be worth to take Soul of the Forest and Stellar Drift. We recommend Mass Entanglement in order to easily proc Sephuz’s Secret.

## Portal Keeper Hasabel

### Talents:

{{< talents spec="balance" src="beta" recommend="232,123,231,132,231,231,231" >}}

Fury of Elune will generally be better than Shooting Stars here due to the length in which the adds live. If your adds are living for prolonged periods of time you should take Soul of the Forest, Stellar Drift, and Shooting Stars. Kil’Jaeden’s Burning Wish + Sephuz’s Secret seems like a good option on this fight as well.

## The Defense of Eonar

### Talents:

{{< talents spec="balance" src="beta" recommend="231,123,231,232,321,231,231" >}}

This will be one of the better fights for Balance Druid’s sustained Multi-Target with some added benefit of Fury of Elune burst damage. Kil’Jaeden’s Burning Wish and Sephuz’s Secret are very good choices here.

## Imonar the Soulhunter

### Talents:

{{< talents spec="balance" src="beta" recommend="132,123,231,123,132,132,231" >}}

Everything is pretty standard here for a boss with high downtime. Fury of Elune abuses the downtime on the platform more than Shooting Stars does. Twin Moons seems better than Stellar Flare due to the amount of unpredictable movement sometimes. Try to steal the interrupt on the boss for your Sephuz proc.

## Kin'garoth

### Talents:

{{< talents spec="balance" src="beta" recommend="123,123,231,123,132,132,231" >}}

If your robot is dying quickly, Fury of Elune will be a very strong choice for the burst damage here, otherwise play shooting stars. All the other options are pretty standard. Twin Moon is better than Stellar Flare because with the ruiner you can get forced to move without mobility and spam moonfire. The Adds spawn every 2 minutes so make sure you use Fury of Elune on the adds every time.

## Varimathras

### Talents:

{{< talents spec="balance" src="beta" recommend="132,132,311,123,132,123,321" >}}

Try to line up your Warrior of Elune uses with shadow spawns. Other than that, this is a very standard fight in terms of what to take.

## The Coven of Shivarra

### Talents:

{{< talents spec="balance" src="beta" recommend="132,123,231,132,231,132,321" >}}

Mass Entanglement here is very good for rooting the adds. You can use Oneth’s Intuition since the two targets are so close together to where you will benefit from the free starfalls. Continue to starsurge on 2 targets.

## Aggramar

### Talents:

{{< talents spec="balance" src="beta" recommend="132,213,231,123,132,132,321" >}}

Warrior of Elune is very strong for movement here. With the removal of Displacer Beast there is also reason to take Tiger Dash if you would like. If your guild is struggling to kill the flames, Incarnation could be a fairly strong choice overall.

## Argus the Unmaker

### Talents:

{{< talents spec="balance" src="beta" recommend="132,123,231,123,132,132,321" >}}

Argus is fairly standard talents. Twin Moons is very good because you can get moonfire cleave value out of the orbs. Warrior of Elune is also very good for the same reason. Everything else is pretty normal.
