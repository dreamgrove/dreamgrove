10.1.5 Changes

>Rising Light, Falling Night Talent Introduction
>A new talent, "Rising Light, Falling Night," increases your damage and healing by 3% during the day and increases your Versatility by 2% at night.

<br>As most people are raiding at night this will just be a 2% Versatility increase, you will never not take this talent.
<br>Anything about instances always being "day" is a not accurate, it's just dependent on the server-time.

>Lunar Shrapnel Redesign
>The Lunar Shrapnel ability was redesigned. Starfall now deals 20% increased damage and is a 1 point talent.

<br>Will probably not see much play outside of consistent AoE fights and big pull dungeons

>Modifications to Wild Surges
>The Wild Surges bonus to Wrath and Starfire critical strike chance was reduced to 12% from 15%.

>Astral Smolder Duration Reduction
>The Astral Smolder duration was reduced from 8 seconds to 6 seconds.

<br>Stellar flare is basically neutral to Astral smolder but the max dps of Astral Smolder is higher, meaning there is no real reason to talent out of it.

>Increase in New Moon, Half Moon, and Full Moon Damage
>New Moon damage increased by 100%.
>Half Moon damage increased by 45%.
>Full Moon damage increased by 15%.

<br>Moons will now be a contender for Single target, ~1% ahead of Fury of Elune

>Fury of Elune Changes
>Radiant Moonlights Fury of Elune cooldown reduction is now 15 seconds (was 20 seconds).
>The damage caused by Fury of Elune was reduced by 10%.

<br>Will still be used for any multi-target scenario over Moons

>Changes to Warrior of Elune
>Warrior of Elune now starts its cooldown as soon as it's activated, but the bonuses to your next 3 Starfires must be used within 25 seconds.

<br>Makes you have to think a bit when you use it so that you actually utilize all charges

>Umbral Intensity Adjustments
>Umbral Intensity now increases damage dealt by Wrath by 20% per point (was 10%) and the damage Starfire deals to nearby targets increased by 15% per point (was 10%).

<br>Probably won't see much play as there are better talents to choose from and it doesn't enable any interesting pathing in the talent tree

>Nature's Grace Change
>Nature's Grace now only triggers after an Eclipse ends, not when extending an Eclipse with Celestial Alignment. This change brings a new dynamic to the utilization of Eclipse during combat.

<br>Doesn't really help with anything, makes you not want to extend incarn with pulsar if possible
 
>Increase in All Spell Damage
>All spell damage dealt by Balance Druids was increased by 5%.

>Changes to Waning Twilight
<br>Waning Twilight's damage and healing were increased to 10%, up from 8%.
