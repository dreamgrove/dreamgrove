All numbers mentioned are backed up using sims found at https://www.dreamgrove.gg/beta/. Please check out this site for detailed info on all combinations. Sims assume all bugs are fixed.

General
Scaling
Wrath Haste caps at 70% Haste which is reached with just base 13.7% Haste during Bloodlust+Celestial Alignment/Incarnation making high Haste feel very bad. Previously we could make slight use of this Haste by switching to Starfire on single target but now due to Starsurge Empowerment you are often stuck casting Wraths far below the gcd cap.
Our damage is very focused in our Celestial Alignment/Incarnation windows due to mastery double dipping and since it is our best stat by a mile we will have a lot of it. The more secondaries and thus mastery we have the more our damage will be focused into the cooldown window making all other timeframes feel worse and worse. Our cooldown being 3 minutes makes this worse.
The plentiful amount of crit buffs make crit undesirable or even useless especially when combined with the legendary Balance of All Things (more about that later)


### AoE and Starfall

A lot of our AoE damage comes from Starfall of which you can’t have more than one up at any time. This means that once enough Astral Power is generated during AoE any further Astral Power has to be used on Starsurge which is not a relevant dps increase or even a dps loss with enough targets (this includes the Empowerment bonus).
This means for high Haste or higher Astral Power generation to feel good we need to be able to effectively spend our Astral Power in some form. This could be done with a stackable Starfall, a hasted Starfall, an option to condense the Starfall damage, a way to empower Starfall with more Astral Power or something along those lines.
Putting more power into Starsurge would start a road down to a situation similar to BfA where we only used Starfall on 7 or more targets with the standard gear setup. Additionally casting a big single target nuke in AoE will always feel bad.

### Starsurge Empowerment

This recent change made Starsurge buff all following fillers in that Eclipse hidden in the tooltip of each Eclipse. Wrath is buffed by an additive 8% during Solar Eclipse and the splash damage modifier of Starfire is buffed by an additive 25% with each cast during Lunar Eclipse.
While more damage is better than no compensation for the removal of the Eclipse extension (which was arguably a good decision), this brings with it a number of problems.
Later Starsurges become worth less than earlier Starsurges in each Eclipse. This means pooling Astral Power is now always a dps loss which is our only way of reliable handling movement during st encounters, effectively nerfing our already lacking movement.
As mentioned earlier making Starsurge increasing AoE damage is a dangerous path as seen in BfA. The splash increase is meaningless for all scenarios outside of Convoke the Spirit casts as shown in the earlier Starfall section.
As a whole the Starsurge Empowerment feels like an afterthought and only has a negative impact on gameplay.

### Tuning

Currently Balance Druid is tuned very low, especially on single target.
Dots deal a laughable amount of damage to the point of Moonfire sometimes not even be worth casting on multiple targets.
Shooting Stars baseline had an extremely minor impact as it’s tuned very low. The extra Astral Power is of little use in AoE scenarios and on single target it generates as little as 4% of our total Astral Power, only going up a small amount with more targets. The increase in power mentioned in a blue post is not implemented as of now.
As a whole our Astral Power generation is very low which leads to rather stale gameplay of pressing your filler about 5 times on single target and 6-7 times in AoE between each spender with dots slowing things down even more due to Shooting Stars generating so little Astral Power. On single target a higher Astral Power generation would help gameplay flow a significant amount but on AoE this would require changes to Starfall to have an impact as described in the AoE and Starfall section.
The various nerfs to our spenders have negatively impacted our potential single target burst and unique spread aoe. Both fillers can make up an equal or close to equal percentage of our damage now depending on the situation which seemingly goes against the filler/spender idea.

### DPS Talents 

### Tier 15:
Nature’s Balance is the clear winner here and solves the problem of having to generate up to 50 Astral Power to start using a filler. Starting from 0 Astral Power means that during AoE and no further CDs it takes about 12 seconds before you can use your first Starfall.
Trees have their niche in tanking but Warrior of Elune is just there and fills a similar purpose as NB while being significantly worse on single target and being roughly on par in aoe.

### Tier 40:

Soul of the Forest is significantly outclassed in all aspects which is fine as it’s the most passive talent
Starlord lasting 20 seconds has problematic timing implications with eclipses lasting 15 seconds. Currently it is the best play to cancel Starlord when it is at low duration allowing for relevant a 1.5% dps increase. Starlord becomes completely useless in AoE scenario as Starfall costing 50 Astral Power and lasting 10 seconds mean you will have at best 2 stacks for a short duration.
Incarnation ends up being the go to since it works in all scenarios.

### Tier 45:

Stellar Flare is similar to Starlord in that it is only good on single target and starts feeling very bad with any further added targets.
Twin Moons and Stellar Drift both fit the exact same “niche” meaning one will always be picked over the other. Currently Starfall is strong enough/dots weak enough for Stellar Drift to always be the superior pick when deciding between the two. A talent move seems like the only good solution in this case.

### Tier 50:

All talents fill the same role which is Astral Power generation and sqrt AoE scaling and with current tuning Fury of Elune simply stands out due to dealing significantly more damage while proving similar Astral Power.
Moons do not scale as well with AoE since only Full Moon splashes meaning it will always fall off on multiple targets which is fine but even on single target it’s outclassed.


### Covenants
Generally only Night Fae is the only Covenant ability that feels good to use (outside its major problems mentioned later). The others are either passive or just used on cd and have barely any impact if any at all on the rotation as they do not interact with the spec itself to a relevant degree.
 
### Kyrian
This covenant is dependent on your partner which can make or break it’s usability. Generally you will simply bind yourself to the highest dps player in the group/raid and hope for the best.
Feels very bland to press as it’s basically a global that increases the damage of 2 people by roughly 30%, more/less one way or the other, for 10 seconds.
Many players feel that essentially giving another player a part of your dps is unfun in addition to the ability already being bland
Assuming both players deal the same amount of dps it’s competitive but outclassed currently

### Necrolord
The effect buffs dots which interestingly enough include Fury of Elune and Starfall
You can have a maximum of 2 debuffs on any targets at any time with just 1 being more common meaning that it has no scaling above 2 targets allowing for anything that does scale with targets to quickly outscale it.
As the hot/dot increase is the same for all Druid specs and Balance Druid currently having the weakest dots mean that it can never be good for Balance Druids as long it isn’t broken for Feral.

### Night Fae
Very volatile ability that as a whole has found the most positive reception in terms of gameplay
The non spec specific casts heavily depend on your surroundings. At range and without any injured allies and under the assumption it casts 13 spells as it currently does due to a bug you end up with ~11.5 damage casts. Going into melee replaces 3-4 Balance Druid spells with Feral spells which deal close to no damage effectively reducing its value by ~30%. Having more injured allies like is usually the case in dungeons and raids replaces another ~2 Balance Druid spells with healing casts. In the worst case that means an unfavorable situation halves the potential damage of a Convoke cast.
The value of this ability lies in its high amount of single target burst but at the same time it has very little AoE value. The extra Starfall or Starsurges are not very useful as discussed in the earlier Starfall section. 
It currently has no smart targeting meaning you cannot focus anything if there are any additional targets present and can hit immune targets which heavily diminishes its value.

### Venthyr
A basically passive macro and forget ability that buffs your Celestial Alignment or Incarnation.
While boring this ability has the upside of always being useful as it simply buffs your damage.
Heavily plays into the problem of Wrath quickly hitting the gcd cap. Even with 0% Haste you hit the gcd cap in only 6 casts during Bloodlust. 
Further forces a significant amount of your damage into our cooldown window every 3 minutes which makes the other 2:40 min feel even worse than it already does.
At higher ranks the conduit that increases the crit chance with each cast will make us go over 100% crit together with various base crit increases like Incarnation.
Its downside seems out of place considering no other covenant ability has a negative effect and for a flavor effect it is way too dangerous. On high stacks it can nearly one shot you in the worst case.

### Legendaries
 
### Balance of All Things

Unique legendary that has a relevant impact on your rotation.
The resulting playstyle consists of casting fillers for about 15secs and then 3 Starsurges ad infinitum for single target
Devalues Haste as the only relevant parts of your damage are now the first few seconds of an Eclipse. The rest of the time is spent building Astral Power for the next Eclipse which soft caps the amount of haste value can get once you always build fully up.
Anti-synergy with our cooldowns which always feels bad.
Bugged to not work on a queued spell when entering an Eclipse.

### Oneth’s Clear Vision

An artifact from Legion with a nerfed proc chance in addition to spenders not being as strong anymore.
Outclassed in all aspects by nearly all other Legendaries in all scenarios. On single target the Starfall is only useful with Stellar Drift which you wouldn’t take on a single target encounter. In AoE the starsurge has very little value and due to the high Astral Power cost of Starfall you get very few procs.

### Primordial Arcanic Pulsar 

Has the upside of always having some value since it now works off Astral Power spend
If it extends Celestial ALignment or Incarnation it has very good value with Starsurge Empowerment but otherwise has anti-synergy with it since it resets all stacks upon entering and only last 9 seconds compared to the standard 15 seconds

### Timeworn Dreambinder

Significantly changes playstyle on single target
Especially with the move away from spender damage it has lost a lot of value and has anti synergy with the Starsurge Empowerments making it fall off.
Completely useless in AoE as it is impossible to keep up the buff when you can only cast Starfall every 10 seconds.



### Conduits

These are weirdly or not all tuned. Fury of the Skies allows dots to be of use even with current tuning.

## Deep Allegiance (Kyrian)

At earlier ranks can be a dps loss due to desyncing with common 2min cds.

## Endless Thirst (Venthyr)

Very strong but as mentioned in the Venthyr section can cause an overcap of Crit.
Currently bugged to give 10 times the intended Crit

## Evolved Swarm (Necrolord)

Our dots being weak means this is weak as well.

## Conflux of Elements (Night Fae)

Simple damage increase with the only caveat being that dots and Starfall cast by Convoke are not affected by it.


Bugs
This will repeat some earlier mentioned bugs
Endless Thirst (venthyr potency) grants 20% Crit per stack, not 2% at base level making it hard to get an accurate picture of how Venthyr actually performs during testing
Convoke the Spirits casts 13 instead of 12 spells since its tick rate is 0.333
Balance of All Things buff application is delayed and only applied after a queued instant spell such as Starsurge
Starfall and Fury of Elune not affected by Circle of Life and Death legendary, despite it counting as a periodic effect for Adaptive Swarm
Solar Eclipse does not reduce the GCD of Wrath further than 0.75s even though its effect is meant to do so as shown by for example Elemental Shamans Storm Elemental Lightning Bolt cast time reduction
Convoke the Spirits will only cast healing spells if you are further than 40yd from the target, even if the target is in range of the rest of your spells
Door of Shadows cannot be cast while moving with stellar drift
