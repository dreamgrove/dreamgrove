We come together (late again) to discuss a variety of hot topics, from Moment of Clarity and Predator in m+, to the upcoming Azerite changes in 8.2!

Since this episode was recorded prior to the release of the new raid we can now update with regards to the strength of the raid items that we discussed.

Boots - Inconsitent but on fights where for some reason AOE does not break the stacks they're pretty good!
Legs - Deffinetly good and worth a pickup!
Trinket - Great but watch out you don't kill yourself on Cabal.

Everything else still sucks.
