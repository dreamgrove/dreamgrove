# Feral Azerite/Talent builds
Feral has been blessed/cursed with a lot of heavily impactful azerite traits, and while it is cool to use 
class specific ones instead of generics, it means that gearing and slecting talents is a little bit more 
involved than for some other classes. This Article will attempt to clarify and disentangle this topic a bit. 
As the subject matter is mostly relevant to people pushing more competitive content, it is aimed at intermediate 
and above ferals but I make not presumptions about skill and so it should be usable even by beginners if they desire it.

To cover this, I'll go over three distinct sections - a more general trait overview (this page), talent build synergies and finally how to figure out which build to use.

## Trait Overview

First of, lets look at some generic traits - we won't cover all of them, but some of them are highly relevant and will reprsent
the rest of the generics pretty well.

### Archive of the Titans & Laser Matrix
The first two generics worth discussing are the two raid generics, they only drop from the raid azerite pieces (and are as such
limited to BfA Season 1) - these two have the unique ability that they will activate the "reorigination array" when inside Uldir
which will give you a significant increase in your best secondary stat. This factor alone makes them near mandatory, when 
raiding you will always want to have atleast one of these on atleast one piece, having more than one does not affect
the array however.

Both of them are decently strong even if you disregard the array (which you would in for example M+) but they are not special
in that environment, and other options will generally beat them.

Of the two, Archive is generally the better one for feral - both of single-target (where they are very even) but since
Laser Matrix splits its damage between multiple targets whereas Archive will just provide stats (that scale with both) 
it is much better in aoe scenarios.

### Dagger in the Back
DitB is the best generic trait for single-target damage, it is highly competitive with class traits in that situation.
It has a drawback if you are hitting a target from the front, where it stacks much slower - but for a melee this drawback is
generally very small since we want to hit from the back anyway.
This trait does not scale at all with more targets, you do not get more procs from AoEing and so will fall off quite quickly
when more targets than one is involved.

So while this trait will rank very highly in Patchwerk simulations, which has made it a very popular farm target
I'd not prioritize getting this for any other purpose than swapping it in on single-target fights, and our class traits are
still better in that scenario.

### Stat procs (Champion of Azeroth, Blightbone Infusion, et al)
These are all fairly good, the value fluxuating with how good the given secondary stat is in your gearset.
Champion of Azeroth is generally the best one, but is only available from one piece (the reputation chest from the CoA faction)
and at a limited item level so it will fall of as you get higher item level pieces.

Blightborn Infusion, Blood Rite, Swirling Sands, Meticulous Scheming are the ones that proc haste and crit (our best secondaries
for the moment) and will generally be the best of these, and are solid choices at the same item level but are generally
outshined by our class traits at the moment.

### Engineering traits (Synaptic Spark Capacitor)
This (and Barrage of Many Bombs, from the same engineering headpiece) is a very good trait, especially in multi-target situation
and does punch well above its weight - but given the limited item level available (340) it will be beaten by most traits
when you reach into the higher item levels. A very good choice while lowly geared though.

### Shredding Fury (Class)
This trait is generally the weakest of our class traits, it will passively cause Tigers Fury to boost the damage of shred which
is a solid perk. It shines a bit more on fights where you get predator procs but still mostly prioritize shredding one target
but is will generally be worse than all but the worst of the generic trait.

### Twisted Claws (Class)
This is probably our most situational choice, **it is really bad on single-target**
- but **very strong in aoe situations**, in fact it is almost always our strongest trait in that situation.
When you have it, every time you thrash each target hit have a chance to give you a stack of agility (up to five stacks)
you always want to maintain this buff and in aoe situations you will therefore clip Thrash to refresh this trait as needed.

You can also gamble with it a bit, while its not generally worth it to try and gain stacks on single-target (you will maintain
thrash like normal with this trait) if you already have a few stacks from an previous aoe phase, you can gamble a fair bit 
clipping thrash at the end of the buff to refresh it (which will keep the previous stacks). 
Keep in mind that you are losing damage from this gamble if you fail to get the refresh, so do not over do it.

This balance dynamic creates a interesting question - if you are looking at doing M+ you almost certainly wants to 
get a full set (3x) of these but since most of us do a bit of M+ and a bit of raiding or pvp and with how limited azerite is
it might be difficult to have two completely opposite sets without a lot of (expensive) reforging.

### Blood Mist (Class)
This is a solid trait as a one pointer in most builds, but because the chance of getting a berserk proc does not increase
with more points than one (only the rake damage increase does) it will never be very appealing to have multiple ones.
To use this trait optimally you definitely need to have a good tracking of the proc, since it can occur at any time and 
you want to use it as much as possible.

The trait is a bit better in situations where you end up multi-doting rake a lot, and is therefore slightly more appealing in
dungeons than in raids but is still only good as a one pointer.

Overall it iss a rather solidly strong trait as a one-off if you get a good piece with it, but nothing stellar.

### Gushing Lacerations (Class)
Very similiar to Blood Mist, the chance to gain combo points do not increase when you stack this trait only the Rip damage does
therefore this trait is only really good as a one pointer. It does perform decently there, especially in situations where you
can keep a lot of rips up and rolling (as both parts of the effect scale with targets in this regard).

When playing with Gushing Lacerations its important to not stay too long at 5 combo points - since that will end up wasting
a lot of procs (especially when you have multiple rips out) instead try and pool at 4 combo points a bit more just in case you
get a proc.

Overall, it is very similiar to Blood Mist in power level and is a solid one pointer but not amazing.

### Raking Ferocity (Class)
One of our absolutely best single-target traits, and has a pretty dramatic impact on Ferocious Bite damage. It does however
heavily relay on Sabertooth, both to cast more bites and by scaling with the damage increase. 

Gameplay-wise it is fairly passive, you will mostly refresh rake with bloodtalons in conjunction with your finisher use anyway
which means you passively gain the benefit on nearly every bite.

Very solid trait all around whenever you are using Sabertooth, and pretty bad otherwise - which does reduce the value
significantly in dungeons but keep it high in raids. (More on that below)

### Iron Jaws (Class)
This trait was long a bit of a meme, the low damage increase to maim meant that it was rarely worth using it even if you had the
trait. Recent buffs have however changed this, and it is now a very viable choice. Much like Raking Ferocity above, this trait
does heavily relay on Sabertooth, since it only procs from Ferocious Bite and you cast very few bites in non-Sabertooth builds.

When you have the trait, you simply use maim as a finisher whenever you have the proc - it is a bit harder to fit it in
if you are not running Sabertooth, since you need to fit it inbetween Rip (and/or SR) refreshes but should mostly be fine.

Similiarily to Raking Ferocity it is all around solid when you have Sabertooth, and quite bad when you don't.

### Power of the Moon (Class)
This is a balance trait (which annoyingly require you to swap to balance to pick it) that does work with Feral Moonfire,
and as such has a hard requirement on Lunar Inspiration to do anything at all for us. That doesn't stop the trait from being a
good choice for us however.

Power of the Moon causes Moonfire to deal significantly increased direct damage, which allows us to substitute Shred as our
primary filler with (the 10 energy cheaper) Moonfire as our primary filler spell. The reason for this is not primarily the 
damage of moonfire (although that helps too) but it also has the benefit of generating more combo points (since you get 
to cast it more often than shred) which leads to more Finisher casts.

When playing with this trait, you will stop maintaing Thrash on single target, and drop Shred as your lowest priority
generator and instead refresh moonfire. You will however still use Thrash and Shred with your Clearcasting procs. It is
worth noting that this means that you won't consume your BT charges like Shred would, which does give you a bit more freedom
to refresh rake when you want.

This is a very solid trait in raiding, especially for single-target, but it does work fine in lower-number-of-targets 
situations too, it does however fall off in dungeons and larger aoe situations since it requires Lunar Inspiration and predator
and to a lesser degree Bloodscent both works better for aoe as well as the fact that Swipe start to overtake it as the number 
of targets increase.

### Wild Fleshrending (Class)
A trait that has developed its own mythos and has a dedicated group of fans around it. Wild Fleshrending is a very good all
around trait, it works well on aoe (with both Brutal Slash and Swipe), it works fairly well on single-target and is good for
burst.

If you are limited with your Azerite choices and want to use a limited set of builds, this is by far the best all arounder
as it has essentially no major weakness and is atleast decent in almost all situations.

Gameplay-wise, the only major thing with this trait is that you need to have thrash up on a target before you start using other
generators. This means that it makes maintaining thrash on single-target mandatory, which is normally not true in other builds.

Overall, while it is mostly not the best trait in any situation it is competitive in all cases and is therefore the best jack
of all trades trait.
