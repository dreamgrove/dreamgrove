Been a couple of months since we posted the last one, but we've had enough changes now to dig into! Discussing Legendaries, Conduits, and of course the Berserk changes.

We did have a minor technical struggle when the recording software crashed so apologies for that but hopefully it does not ruin your enjoyment too much!
