Generally, with the exception of trinkets, you will just want to use whatever is the highest item level items you have available.

If you are dying, or taking too much damage, it is because you or members of your group are playing poorly. It is not because of your gear. If your DPS is too low, your gear will be more relevant but it will be a tiny factor compared to the play of again both you and other members of your group.

**Broadly speaking**:

 - For chest/legs/helm - anything more than a 5 item level upgrade will be better. If it’s within 5 item levels, and the lower piece is not versatility/mastery, go with the higher item level item.
 - For Shoulders/Boots/Gloves/Belt - anything more than a 10 item level upgrade will be better.
 - For Bracers/Cloak - anything more than a 20 item level upgrade will be better.
 - Sockets do not make a notable difference for armour pieces for defensive purposes.

**For jewellery**:

 - If it has versatility and mastery, consider it to be +20 item levels. If it has versatility or mastery as the higher stat, or if they’re fairly close together, consider it to be +10. If it has versatility or mastery as the lower stat, consider it to be +5. Sockets are worth ~10 item levels at ~860 average item level or lower; and ~5 item levels at higher average item level.

### Stats

#### Survivability

**Armour (for most physical damage) > Stamina > Versatility > Mastery > Haste > Crit > Agility**

Armour from most of your gear is not the same as armour on trinkets or enchants. The former is increased by {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}}, and the latter is not. Armour is extremely good at reducing physical damage taken. The vast majority of relevant damage when playing the game is physical. Armour does not generally reduce damage taken from bleeds, but there are some exceptions on a boss-by-boss basis (such as Harjatan from Tomb of Sargeras).

Stamina is excellent at increasing your Effective Health. Although this is not useful if you already know you are going to survive and merely want to reduce your damage taken, the caveat “if you already know you are going to survive” is not a useful one when discussing survivability. Stamina is excellent at helping make sure you do in fact actually survive, for example by giving healers more time to heal you, or ensuring you live against spike damage.

Versatility is good for its damage reduction and for increasing your healing done by {{< spell 22842 "Frenzied Regeneration" >}}. Its damage reduction component gets better the more you have. There are no ‘caps’.

Mastery essentially does the same thing as Versatility but worse, and does not affect {{< spell 22842 "Frenzied Regeneration" >}}. It does this by increasing your health and your healing received - which is in effect the same thing as reducing your damage taken.

Haste allows you to use your abilities faster (due to reducing the Global Cooldown and the cooldown of {{< spell 33917 "Mangle" >}} and {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}}, and your autoattacks), so you get more rage. It also reduces the cooldown of {{< spell 22842 "Frenzied Regeneration" >}}.

Agility and Crit both give nothing but dodge (technically Agility gives slightly more absorb from {{< spell 203953 "Brambles" >}}, but this is not a defensive talent); and dodge is an unreliable stat and the amount of it you get is very low per point of Crit or Agility. As such, they are worth almost nothing for survivability.

You cannot realistically sim yourself for survivability. The primary reason for this is that there are no particularly good metrics to measure it by. You can measure your “total external healing required to keep you alive” - the lower, the better - but a tank who has a higher total external healing required to be kept alive may still be a better tank than another, who needs less in total, because they are easier to heal, or survive more reliably. The metric “TMI” can be used to measure spikiness in health, but again this is not useful in isolation.

#### DPS

**Agility > Haste > Versatility > Crit > Mastery**

If you have reasonably good gear (approximately 950-960 on average or higher), and decent Netherlight Crucible traits, then Agility may move below some or all of the secondary stats per point. You can sim yourself for DPS and it can tell you what stats are worth for DPS with your gear. If you don’t know how to do that, there is a guide [here](https://goo.gl/9DxCK0).

### Gems and Enchants

For survivability, use versatility gems. For DPS, sim yourself and use the gems corresponding to whatever your best stat is. Often, versatility will be at least very nearly the best stat for DPS if not the best, so you may just want to use versatility gems to cover both bases. The same applies for ring enchants. Agility is usually the go-to cloak enchant although the Warlords of Draenor versatility enchant is marginally better for survivability.

For neck enchants:
 - Survivability (against physical damage, i.e. most damage) - {{< spell 141908 "Mark of the Heavy Hide" >}}
 - Survivability (against magic damage specifically) - {{< spell 141909 "Mark of the Trained Soldier" >}}
 - DPS (on 1 to approximately 3 targets) - {{< spell 141909 "Mark of the Hidden Satyr" >}}
 - DPS (on 4+ targets) - {{< spell 128551 "Mark of the Claw" >}}

### Trinkets

#### Survivability

See [the defensive trinket guide](https://goo.gl/u7s0nm).

#### DPS

See this [offensive trinket sims chart](https://faideww.github.io/guardian-trinkets/) for a rough outline of what to aim for.  To obtain the most accurate results, you should sim yourself.

#### Pantheon Trinkets

Generally you will want to use a Pantheon trinket (particularly in raids). You have three options - {{< item 154172 "Aman'Thul's Vision" >}} (if you’re lucky enough to get one); {{< item 154173 "Aggramar’s Conviction" >}}; and {{< item 154174 "Golganneth’s Vitality" >}}.

Realistically in raids you will be choosing between {{< item 154172 "Aman'Thul's Vision" >}} and {{< item 154173 "Aggramar’s Conviction" >}}, since you are one of the two members of the raid who can produce the “Tank proc” (the other being your co-tank), which will improve proc diversity and in general boost average uptime on the pantheon empowerment buff for the entire raid. Both defensively and offensively {{< item 154172 "Aman'Thul's Vision" >}} is better than {{< item 154173 "Aggramar’s Conviction" >}} at item level 1000, with the added benefit of dropping at 1000 and not needing to be upgraded.

Outside of raids you have one additional choice. Since {{< item 154174 "Golganneth’s Vitality" >}} provides negligible defensive value, it should only be considered offensively.  On single target at ilevel 1000 and with {{< item 151802 "Fury of Nature" >}} equipped, {{< item 154174 "Golganneth’s Vitality" >}} (despite it having a reduced proc rate and damage for tanks) performs slightly better than {{< item 154173 "Aggramar’s Conviction" >}}, which performs far better than {{< item 154172 "Aman'Thul's Vision" >}} due to the vast majority of {{< item 154172 "Aman'Thul's Vision" >}} value for Guardians being tied into its Pantheon empowerment (which cannot activate outside of raid zones).  In AoE {{< item 154173 "Aggramar’s Conviction" >}} pulls far ahead thanks to {{< item 154174 "Golganneth’s Vitality" >}} split damage.

### Tier

Tier 21 is very weak. It’s not actively harmful and naturally you should use tier items if they are your best items anyway; but it’s generally barely worth considering at all. If you have exceptionally high item level tier 20 or tier 19 gear it may be worth considering defensively, but only if it competes in item level with your other gear. A more detailed analysis of why the tier 21 gear is not particularly good can be found [here]({{< ref "guardian/2018-02-09-guardian-tier-21-analysis.md" >}}).

### Relics

A guide to where relics can be looted, sorted by their default trait, can be found [here](https://goo.gl/KcvnXd).

#### Survivability

Relic item level does not matter for survivability almost at all compared to the traits themselves. All the netherlight crucible traits that give healing are basically worthless for survivability; the only relevant ones are the ones that give stats. Although avoidance is generally negligible (except on certain specific boss mechanics), you get a very large amount of avoidance from the {{< spell 252091 "Master of Shadows" >}} trait, in addition to Mastery, which is a good defensive stat. {{< spell 252088 "Light Speed" >}} is also reasonable defensively.

More important than the secondary traits from the Crucible are the main traits. {{< spell 200399 "Ursoc's Endurance" >}} and {{< spell 238049 "Scintillating Moonlight" >}} are the best defensive traits by far; though {{< spell 200400 "Wildflesh" >}} and {{< spell 200395 "Reinforced Fur" >}} are not very far behind at 3 and 4. {{< spell 200414 "Bestial Fortitude" >}} is okay but not very good. {{< spell 200415 "Sharpened Instincts" >}} and {{< spell 200402 "Perpetual Spring" >}} are negligible.

#### DPS

Generally, {{< spell 200409 "Jagged Claws" >}} is easily the strongest sole DPS trait. However due to the Netherlight Crucible, this does not necessarily mean much in and of itself. Use the [Netherlight Crucible Calculator](https://goo.gl/14pnqz) to work out what your best relics are for DPS.

Alternatively you can use [these strings](https://goo.gl/8JHtxv) for the “Crucible Weights” addon.

### Legendaries

#### Survivability

In order from best to worst:

1. {{< item 137015 "Ekowraith, Creator of Worlds" >}}
2. {{< item 151636 "Soul of the Archdruid" >}}[^1]
3. {{< item 137041 "Dual Determination" >}}[^2]
4. {{< item 132444 "Prydaz, Xavaric's Magnum Opus" >}}
5. {{< item 137025 "Skysec's Hold" >}}
6. {{< item 144249 "Archimonde's Hatred Reborn" >}}[^3]
7. {{< item 144432 "Oakheart's Puny Quods" >}}
8. {{< item 137067 "Elize's Everlasting Encasement" >}}[^4]

[^1]: For fights where the majority of the damage is physical damage (i.e. most fights).

[^2]: For fights where you get an extra use of {{< spell 61336 "Survival Instincts" >}}, at a time where that extra cooldown is relevant - this rarely happens but is very powerful if it does (planned in advance).
[^3]: When you don’t have good trinkets to replace it, the legendary trinket is strong. It can also be used as an “extra cooldown”.
[^4]: If you are using {{< item 137067 "Elize's Everlasting Encasement" >}}, you should (almost) always be using {{< spell 204053 "Rend and Tear" >}}.

The reason why {{< item 137025 "Skysec's Hold" >}} are not as good as they might first appear is that they will often overheal, or otherwise cause other players’ healing to be overhealing when it would have been useful healing.

In dungeons, or in situations where people are not able to heal you much, you will generally benefit more from {{< item 137025 "Skysec's Hold" >}} than {{< item 132444 "Prydaz, Xavaric's Magnum Opus" >}}.

{{< item 144249 "Archimonde's Hatred Reborn" >}} will be more useful than depicted above if you are using it to mitigate a specific boss ability, where it acts as an additional cooldown.

#### DPS

On single target, the best legendary pair is {{< item 151802 "Fury of Nature" >}} paired with {{< item 137067 "Elize's Everlasting Encasement" >}}’s Everlasting Encasement (unless you can make use of {{< item 132452 "Sephuz's Secret" >}}’s proc on cooldown in which case that is stronger than {{< item 137067 "Elize's Everlasting Encasement" >}}, though this is usually not feasible in a raid encounter).

On two or more targets, the best legendary pair is {{< item 151802 "Fury of Nature" >}} combined with {{< item 144295 "Lady and the Child" >}} (only lootable as Balance specialisation). {{< item 144295 "Lady and the Child" >}} changes your rotation significantly (see the rotation sections).

{{< item 144295 "Lady and the Child" >}} is as good as it is because of a bug. This bug has gone unfixed for a very long time (although in 7.3.5 the bug was changed to operate in a slightly different way). The way the bug now works is that if you get a {{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}} proc whilst you already have the {{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}} buff up, the secondary {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} created by the shoulders will be buffed as if it had been a manual cast under the effect of {{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}}, i.e. it will do 300% extra initial damage and generate 8 rage. For this reason, your rotations using {{< item 144295 "Lady and the Child" >}} differ significantly to without (see the rotation sections below for more details).

If you do not have both of the best legendaries and want to know what your best pair is in a particular situation, sim yourself. If you have {{< item 137056 "Luffa Wrappings" >}} and e.g. {{< item 132452 "Sephuz's Secret" >}}, and you do not have {{< item 151802 "Fury of Nature" >}} or {{< item 144295 "Lady and the Child" >}}, then in large aoe situations (such as in mythic+ dungeons) you may want to consider using {{< spell 102558 "Incarnation: Guardian of Ursoc" >}}.
