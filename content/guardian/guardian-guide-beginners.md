Whilst levelling, don’t worry about what you spend artifact power on. It doesn’t matter; you will have a fully empowered artifact immediately after hitting 110 anyway.

### Main abilities

 - {{< spell 33917 "Mangle" >}} – Single target, generates rage – note that its cooldown can be reset by other abilities.
 - {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} – AoE, generates rage, better than Swipe
 - {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}} – AoE, filler
 - {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} – Generates rage with {{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}} talented, reduces your damage taken via {{< spell 238049 "Scintillating Moonlight" >}}
 - {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}} – Active mitigation, and primary defensive spender. Reduces physical damage taken
 - {{< spell 22842 "Frenzied Regeneration" >}} – Heals you based on damage taken just before using it
 - {{< spell 22812 "Barkskin" >}} – Small defensive cooldown
 - {{< spell 61336 "Survival Instincts" >}} – Large defensive cooldown

### Talents for Beginners

These are not necessarily the best talents to use in any particular situation. They are, however, the easiest.

 - {{< spell 203962 "Blood Frenzy" >}}
 - {{< spell 204012 "Guttural Roars" >}}
 - {{< spell 197632 "Balance Affinity" >}}
 - {{< spell 5211 "Mighty Bash" >}}
 - {{< spell 158477 "Soul of the Forest" >}} ({{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}} if you have {{< item 151636 "Soul of the Archdruid" >}})
 - {{< spell 203974 "Earthwarden" >}}
 - {{< spell 204053 "Rend and Tear" >}}

### Rotation for beginners

Again it must be stressed that this rotation is not necessarily the actual best rotation you ought to be using, either for survivability or DPS, in any particular circumstance. However if you are new to the spec or to the game it will perform adequately for many purposes, and help whilst you familiarise yourself with what your abilities do.

 - {{< spell 33917 "Mangle" >}} on cooldown -> {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} on cooldown -> Use {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} if it’s not up on the target or is about to run out -> {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}}.

 - Make sure all Global Cooldowns are filled by queueing abilities, i.e. press the button just before it’s ready. You should never have gaps in between casts.

 - Use {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}} when you are taking physical damage, and use {{< spell 22842 "Frenzied Regeneration" >}} when you need healing.

 - Use {{< spell 22812 "Barkskin" >}} when you are taking significant damage.

 - Use {{< spell 200851 "Rage of the Sleeper" >}} when you are about to take heavy damage, or as a DPS cooldown if you don’t need it to survive. Note that thanks to an artifact trait ({{< spell 200855 "Embrace of the Nightmare" >}}), you will also do a lot of extra self-healing (particularly when fighting lots of enemies) during Rage of the Sleeper, in addition to the 25% Damage Reduction.

 - Use {{< spell 61336 "Survival Instincts" >}} when you are about to take extremely heavy damage and you are not sure that you will survive without it.

 - Try not to use multiple Damage Reduction cooldowns together unless you think you need to do that in order to survive.
