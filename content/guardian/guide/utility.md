{{< spell 106839 "Skull Bash" >}} – your basic interrupt. Can be used from slightly-further-than-melee-range away from the target (and more, if using {{< spell 197632 "Balance Affinity" >}}).

{{< spell 99 "Incapacitating Roar" >}} – This is an aoe disorient. This is especially useful for stopping enemies from casting when you can’t ordinarily interrupt them, or when there are too many to interrupt all the casts. Note that if you have both the talent {{< spell 204012 "Guttural Roars" >}} and {{< spell 197488 "Balance Affinity" >}}, the range of this ability is enormous, and it can pull enemies from places you were not expecting.

{{< spell 106898 "Stampeding Roar" >}} – Very useful ability in certain raid encounters; and just generally good to have especially in dungeons.

{{< spell 5211 "Mighty Bash" >}} (talent) – Single target stun.

{{< spell 132469 "Typhoon" >}} (talent) – AoE knockback; particularly useful for dungeons where you need to kite the enemies.

{{< spell 102359 "Mass Entanglement" >}} (talent) – AoE root. Usually not very good, but excellent in certain specific situations, such as on Coven of Shivarra or Aggramar, both from the Antorus raid.

{{< spell 200851 "Rage of the Sleeper" >}} – Ordinarily used as a DPS or Survivability cooldown, this ability also (thanks to the artifact trait {{< spell 200855 "Embrace of the Nightmare" >}}) makes you immune to being CC’d if you have it up whilst you are hit with the CC. This is very useful in certain particular dungeon or raid encounters - for example, you can get rid of the whirlwinds that stun on contact from the last boss of Court of Stars by using {{< spell 200851 "Rage of the Sleeper" >}} and running into them; or you can immune the fear from the Felhounds of Sargeras raid encounter by using {{< spell 200851 "Rage of the Sleeper" >}} before it goes on you.

{{< spell 20484 "Rebirth" >}} – Combat resurrection.

{{< spell 5215 "Prowl" >}} – Stealth. Can be useful in some dungeons.

{{< spell 1850 "Dash" >}} – Makes you enter cat form and gives you high movement speed whilst in cat form. You do not need to be in cat form to cast it in the first place.
