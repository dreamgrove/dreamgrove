Shadowlands has finally arrived! Naturally there are many questions being asked 
# Covenants

**What covenant should I choose?** 

***IT IS IMPORTANT TO STATE THAT EVERY COVENANT WORKS WELL, AND THAT YOU CAN PICK THE ONE YOU PREFER AND NOT GIMP YOURSELF***

* Every covenant is within 5 to 7% of each other depending on the situation (ST/cleave/AOE) (Please refer to the [sims](https://www.dreamgrove.gg/sims/bear/) for more information)

* Night Fae is likely the ideal choice if you are going to Offspec as it is the best for resto and very good for feral, it also offers another burst damage/survivability cooldown, that said in {{< spell 5487 "bear form" >}}, {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} can feel random at times and you cannot control if you get more damage/survivability. You can also use it in other form for more damage or another healing cooldown 

* Necrolord offers one of the best priority damage out of the covenant we have access to, some self healing capabilities if you cast {{< spell 325727 "Adaptive Swarm" >}} on yourself. But will drop off as the target count increases. That is in part mitigated with the soulbind they have access to.

* Kyrian gives you an ability that can give you either strong defensive capabilities/utility or some offensive potential,and, unlike Night Fae you can control which one you get. It can have a few downside (relying on other people, the {{< spell 327022 "dps tether" >}} acting as a 15% {{< spell 190456 "Ignore Pain" >}} and thus can end up wasting a bit of the damage). But unlike necrolord its dps is constant and does not drop off either in ST or AOE. Furthermore Pelagos is still a strong soulbind. 
Important to note that if you can avoid it you should never use the solo bond of the ability as it is inferior to any other benefits.

* Venthyr gives you {{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}}, which if paired with {{< spell 102558 "Incarn" >}} probably gives you one of the strongest 3 minute burst in the game, has virtually no downside (you have the GCD+2sec before getting stunned while being idle and bears are GCD locked). Venthyr also has access to strong soulbind for ST, where it will struggle a bit more than other covenant.

TLDR; Pick the one you prefer it is rather very close and is unlikely to make or break what you are doing 

### Nightfae

**Dreamweaver** vs. **Niya**:
The downside to **Dreamweaver's** Podtender, When the cheat death is activated, all threat is reset thus redirecting every mob you previously had to your group. Whilst in the pod you are unable to be battle resurrected making you watch your group suffer. That being said, in a well organized group it is a non issue so that's particularly why you would see it in top keys. 

*This may be less relevant in raids, but is a big red flag for m+.*

**Niya** tends to sim higher for some but we understand that is not a priority for a select amount of people, {{< spell 322721 "Grove Invigoration" >}} gives a good amount of stats and health. 


### How To Kyrian Tether


First off, your base spell {{< spell 326434 "Kindred Spirits" >}} (2,5s cast time, only usable in caster form)

You first have to use that spell to either bond yourself with an ally or, if there is no ally around, with yourself. You can change your bonded partner any time.
Depending on the target you did bond yourself to, you gain different active spells, each with a 1 min CD:

**On yourself:** {{< spell 338018 "Lone Protection" >}} - 10% less damage taken for 10s.

**On another player:** First off, 40% of the damage your partner takes for the next 10s is redirected to you (this effect stops after 10s or if you fall below 20% health, {{< spell 327037 "Kindred Protection" >}}

*What do you gain in exchange?*

**Bonded to a tank**:
You gain also {{< spell 327037 "Kindred Protection" >}}, so 40% of the damage you will take will be transferred to your co-tank - except the damage that got transferred from him at the same time. Mind that this only shifts damage and should only be used if one of you is dying to a certain mechanic otherwise.

**Bonded to a healer**: 
{{< spell 327071 "Kindred Focus" >}}, for the next 10s you receive 30% of the healing dealt by your bonded parter. 

**Bonded to a DPS**: 
For the next 10s you collect 20% of the damage they deal in a pool {{< spell 327022 "Kindred Empowerment" >}}. 
You use this pool to strengthen your damage, your healing and your absorb by 15% for up to 20s after activating this ability (until you used up the pool).
The "absorb" part means that hits against you during that time get reduced by 15% (similar to how "{{< spell 190456 "Ignore Pain" >}}" from warriors works).

# Gearing

### Stats

Generally speaking, Versatility/{{< spell 155783 "Mastery" >}} is a good defensive setup but rarely does one need to go full defensive so alternatively going Vers/Haste is a good middle ground.

Offensively secondary stats can change from player to player so the best bet is to refer to personal sims through [Raidbots.](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/stats)

For more information please visit the [Wowhead](https://www.wowhead.com/guardian-druid-stat-priority-guide) and [Icyveins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/guardian-druid-pve-tank-stat-priority) guides, both written by Pumps. 
### Legendaries 

Ignoring what your alternative items are for each slot, here is a rule of thumb for legendary crafting slot selection:

Chest >= Legs >= Head > Ring = Amulet > Shoulders >= Boots >= Belt = Gloves > Wrist > Cloak



This is generally going to be the most bang for your buck out of the extra ilvl, with some variance on the relative value of jewelry depending on what you are optimizing for.

**What legendary do I want to build and on which piece?** 

We have a multitude of strong legendary choices, each strong in its own place:


* Defensively:
 
  * {{< spell 339063 "The Natural Order's Will" >}} (NOW) - Will see use in cutting edge keys and in early raid progression when undergeared. Paired with {{< spell 203965 "Survival of the Fittest" >}} and {{< spell 340529 "Tough as Bark" >}} at Rank 7, this allows for 36% uptime on 30% DR  (Drops from Huntsman Altimor, Castle Nathria)

  * {{< spell 340059 "Lycara’s Fleeting Glimpse" >}} (Lycara's) - Decent {{< spell 22812 "Barkskin" >}} uptimes, but currently falls victim to the proc happening within the first 45sec of combat and not after 45 sec of combat which makes it a bit unreliable in a dungeon environment though it has *some* potential play for shifting into {{< spell 24858 "Owl Form" >}} and {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}}'ing. (Drops from Mordretha, Theater of Pain)

* Offensively:

  * {{< spell 339060 "Luffa-Infused Embrace" >}} (Luffa's) - Big {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} Damage, also provides another stack of {{< spell 204053 "Rend and Tear" >}}. ((Drops from Kryxis the Voracious, Sanguine Depths))

  * {{< spell 338657 "Circle of Life and Death" >}} (Circle) - If you cat/owl weave it's equal to {{< spell 339060 "Luffa" >}} in ST. (Drops from Stone Legion Generals, Castle Nathria)

  * {{< spell 338658 "Draught of Deep Focus" >}} (DoDF) - In pure ST, this will be the best leggo offensively for Kyrian and Venthyr. It'll be Best ST option for all convenants if you catweave. If you {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}, {{< spell 1822 "rake" >}}, {{< spell 1079 "rip" >}}, or {{< spell 774 "rejuve" >}} more than one target this becomes useless and the effect does not see use. (Drops from The Great Vault)

* Both:

  * {{< spell 339056 "Ursoc’s Fury Remembered" >}} (UFR) - Consistent absorb, more {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} damage, falls off the higher you push in keys. Most players will not reach the threshhold where it'll be weaker than {{< spell 339063 "NOW" >}}. (Drops from Torghast, Coldheart Interstitia, Layer 3+)


***What are you building??***

For m+, most people are aiming for {{< spell 339056 "UFR" >}} first. It will be awhile before you will need {{< spell 339063 "NOW" >}} and currently we still have not reached that point. For example, as of writing this, the top guardian uses {{< spell 339056 "UFR" >}} in 7 out of the 8 dungeons.

For Raid, most are aiming for {{< spell 338658 "Draught" >}} or {{< spell 339060 "Luffa" >}} for damage. {{< spell 339063 "NOW" >}} is generally seen as overkill for raid.

**This does not mean you have to create something else while waiting for those two. Waiting to craft is perfectly fine.**

## Threat, Damage, and You

***I am having threat issues, what do I do??***

**The short answer:** Press thrash and swipe more

**The long answer:** Above 3 targets anything outside of {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}}/{{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}} is a loss of aoe threat, ie your priority 99% of the time is to spam {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}}/{{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}} on your opener. 
So for your opener, you want to use {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} then 3 {{< spell 213764 "Swipes" >}} then {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} again, rince and repeat, once you have built up threat, you can spread {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} to the mobs instead of {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}} for more damage and ***IF*** you have an issue on one mob don’t hesitate to use {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}/{{< spell 33917 "mangle" >}} on it to get some quick threat.
Another good tip is to wait that all the trash is in range of {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} before pressing it, as it's our best aoe ability and the only uncapped tool we have so you do not want to waste a use early.

**Important to note:** - opening with {{< spell 6795 "Taunt" >}} on single target is highly advised, and {{< spell 102558 "Incarn" >}}/{{< spell 106951 "Zerk" >}} will reduce {{< spell 6795 "Taunt" >}} CD to the GCD.
-the cap on {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}} is proximity based, so if you have more than five mobs around you can wiggle around to hit different targets with each {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}}.

**I keep hearing about Catweaving and Owlweaving, what is it and how do I properly maintain the rotation?**

Simply put catweaving and owlweaving is when you switch forms, when out of harms way, to push out a little bit of extra damage when survivability is no longer an issue. 

* **Catweaving:** Switch to {{< spell 768 "cat form" >}} when {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}}/{{< spell 33917 "Mangle" >}} is on CD and you have no rage to spend, apply {{< spell 1822 "Rake" >}}, deplete all your energy with {{< spell 5221 "Shred" >}}, and if at 4 or 5 combo points apply {{< spell 1079 "rip" >}}, switch back to {{< spell 5487 "bear" >}}, rinse and repeat. This rotation is mostly concerning single target.

* **Owlweaving:** Cast {{< spell 319454 "Heart of the Wild" >}}, cast {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}/{{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} on target cast two {{< spell 5176 "Wrath" >}} cast {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}}, proceed to follow {{< spell 79577 "Eclipse" >}} rotation for the duration of {{< spell 319454 "Heart of the Wild" >}}, when out of it, if you have {{< spell 33917 "mangle" >}}/{{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} in CD, if you have no rage to spend, and if you're going to use {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}}, switch to {{< spell 24858 "boomy" >}} and cast {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} on the target, switch back to {{< spell 5487 "bear" >}}. When in aoe, if you are outside of melee range you can switch into {{< spell 24858 "boomy" >}} to put {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} on mobs, it is quite solid damage.

PSA: **YOU DO NOT** blow a CD to switch form to do damage, that is a meme thing to do in non relevant content, do not do it when progging in raids or pushing in m+.

## Simulations

[Shadowlands Bear Sims.](https://www.dreamgrove.gg/sims)


### HOW DO I SIM??

**FIRST**: Understand that simming is only for dps, any website or person telling you they can sim survivability is either lying or being massively reductive, or both.

Now that that’s out of the way, download the Simulationcraft [addon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/simulationcraft), take the input it gives you and go to [Raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot) pick the option you want; specifically the important ones are:

* *[Quick sim](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/quick)* will just run a sim of your character with your current gear.

* *[Top gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear)* checks all the gear you have equipped (and if you have the weekly chest open it will take those into account as well) allows you to pick and choose every option you wanna check out (gear/talent/conduit/soulbind) run all the sims and tell you which one is the best for you.

* *[Droptimizer](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/droptimizer)* runs the loot from dungeons/raid/pvp and tells you where your biggest upgrade will come out.

 Once you’ve chosen the one you’re interested in, select the fight style  you are interested in under simulation options;

* **Patchwerk** is basically just you hitting a dummy (or several) for a certain amount of time, it’s good to see how much damage you can expect uninterrupted on a boss.

* **Hectic add cleave** is more niche and is one dummy with several wave of small adds spawning to try and simulate bosses with adds that comes by wave, rarely used.

* **Dungeonslice** tries to simulate a dungeon, it is not perfect, but if you wanna get the best bang for your buck in an m+ environment, it is fine for a premade profile.

Once you picked that, click run the simulation, wait and after a while you will have your dps and the best gear you have available currently shown to you, by the power of my APL and computers.

As with all generalized charts, these are for informational purposes only and DO NOT accurately reflect your own character. You should ALWAYS use [Raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear) to sim your own character instead of relying solely on general charts like these.

Currently the APL is going to cast {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} in the affinity form you have selected ({{< spell 197488 "boomkin affinity " >}} {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} in {{< spell 24858 "boomkin" >}}); **If you wish to sim with bear {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} please select the {{< spell 197492 "restoration affinity" >}} talent**

To sim Catweaving, one needs to add druid.catweave_bear=1 into the **Custom APL** section. 

The current Basic set up is using Balance affinity and {{< spell 319454 "Heart of the Wild" >}} as talents (ergo sims will always use {{< spell 24858 "boomkin" >}} {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}}, and always shift in {{< spell 24858 "boomkin" >}} form for {{< spell 340059 "Lycara" >}})

# Talents

***EARTHWARDEN Vs. SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST***

If you have crafted {{< spell 339063 "The Natural Order's Will" >}} (NOW), you have probably wondered if it is worth using {{< spell 203965 "SotF" >}} over {{< spell 203974 "EW" >}} all the time. The first thing you need to understand is that the choice *is not* legendary dependent, while it is true that {{< spell 339063 "The Natural Order's Will" >}} (NOW) renders {{< spell 203965 "SotF" >}} more attractive, some situations warrant the use of {{< spell 203965 "SotF" >}} while not using it, or the use of {{< spell 203974 "EW" >}} while using {{< spell 339063 "NOW" >}}.

***What does this mean?*** 
- Essentially, you need to look at your damage breakdown, if you are in an encounter where you take a lot of melee damage (think Hungering destroyer or Mist of Tirna Scythe dungeon) {{< spell 203974 "EW" >}} will be significantly more attractive than {{< spell 203965 "SotF" >}} since it will allow you to mitigate the majority of your damage taken (ie melees) while still having access to {{< spell 22812 "bark" >}} on top.
- On the other extreme, if you are taking more magic damage (such as on inerva in the raid), or physical damage not mitigated by {{< spell 203974 "EW" >}} (think mutilate from the abomination in Necrotic Wake) {{< spell 203965 "SotF" >}} will be more attractive.
In short, look at your damage breakdown, if melee is the bigger damage intake, {{< spell 203974 "Earthwarden" >}} is better, if it is not it is possible that {{< spell 203965 "SotF" >}} is better. **AND THOSE THINGS MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION REGARDLESS OF YOU USING {{< spell 339063 "NOW" >}}**

As for the conduit {{< spell 340529 "TaB" >}}, it is our opinion that people tend to overestimate it, you absolutely do not need to use it if you use {{< spell 339063 "NOW" >}}, it’s a 9 to 6 sec reduction if used with {{< spell 203965 "SotF" >}}, which translate to maybe one more use in an entire fight in the raid, and in m+ you have period where {{< spell 22812 "bark" >}} will cool off, due to less damage intake/moving about. So for this, if {{< spell 340529 "TaB" >}} allows you more {{< spell 22812 "bark" >}} usage/mitigating something that would not be possible otherwise, consider it, otherwise it is not a *must always use* adapt your conduits to your situation.
