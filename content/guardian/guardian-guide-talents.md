### Level 15

{{< spell 203953 "Brambles" >}} generally provides the highest DPS, since it gives more throughput than the extra {{< spell 6807 "Maul" >}}s you would get from the rage gained through the alternatives. Use it paired with {{< spell 200851 "Rage of the Sleeper" >}}, unless you are using {{< spell 203965 "Survival of the Fittest" >}}, in which case it should be used on cooldown, to maximise DPS.

{{< spell 155835 "Bristling Fur" >}} is generally the best choice for survivability. It generates rage based on damage taken after mitigation, so you will generate a lot more rage if you use it with zero stacks or one stack of {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}} up compared to two or three. It’s best used immediately preceding a period of very heavy physical damage.

{{< spell 155835 "Bristling Fur" >}} hypothetically can be strongest for DPS on single target if you are taking an extremely large amount of damage, and not spending rage on {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}}. This will allow you to generate extra rage for additional casts of {{< spell 6807 "Maul" >}}. However, the benefit from the additional casts of {{< spell 6807 "Maul" >}} is actually quite low unless you are directly replacing a cast of {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}} in your rotation - if you are delaying {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} or {{< spell 33917 "Mangle" >}} then the marginal gain is much lower. You also need to ensure you don’t waste any rage. In practice it is extremely hard, if not impossible, for {{< spell 155835 "Bristling Fur" >}} to beat {{< spell 203953 "Brambles" >}} in terms of DPS.

{{< spell 203962 "Blood Frenzy" >}} can be worth taking when you have several targets within {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} range throughout the entire encounter. It may be worth using on very high fortified mythic+ dungeons, as enemies survive a reasonably long time, and do damage in a constant manner rather than in short bursts. It is generally not worth taking on fewer than 3 constant targets.

### Level 30

{{< spell 204012 "Guttural Roars" >}} is a sensible default option, although note that it will make the range of {{< spell 99 "Incapacitating Roar" >}} so large it may be unusable in dungeons if you are also using {{< spell 197488 "Balance Affinity" >}}.

{{< spell 132302 "Wild Charge" >}} is also very nice as a gap closer. It is exceptionally good if you are using {{< item 132452 "Sephuz's Secret" >}} in dungeons as it will proc from the charge.

{{< spell 236748 "Intimidating Roar" >}} is usually a poor choice. Many enemies can be disoriented by {{< spell 99 "Incapacitating Roar" >}} but not by {{< spell 236748 "Intimidating Roar" >}}, so it actually reduces your utility in those situations.


### Level 45

{{< spell 197492 "Restoration Affinity" >}} is a sensible default option if you are looking for any additional survivability. The healing it provides is rarely operative or overly impactful, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t there.

{{< spell 197488 "Balance Affinity" >}} is probably the most widely used ‘general purpose’ of the three, as it is very nice to have extra range on your melee abilities, particularly for {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} and {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}} in dungeons or certain raid encounters.

{{< spell 202155 "Feral Affinity" >}} is useful for certain situations where the extra movement speed helps deal with a particular mechanic. It is never in practice worth changing into Cat Form to try to do more DPS.

### Level 60

{{< spell 5211 "Mighty Bash" >}} or {{< spell 132469 "Typhoon" >}} will be the most useful depending on what you’re doing, although {{< spell 102359 "Mass Entanglement" >}} is extremely good in certain specific situations.

### Level 75

{{< spell 158477 "Soul of the Forest" >}} is the best talent defensively on exactly one target. If there are two or more targets, and/or you are using {{< item 151636 "Soul of the Archdruid" >}}, then the best defensive talent is {{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}}.

The best talent for DPS is almost always {{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}}.

For extreme burst aoe, {{< spell 102558 "Incarnation: Guardian of Ursoc" >}} is better for that particular period whilst it’s up. Naturally you lose a significant amount of DPS whilst it’s on cooldown, but this may still be worth it depending on your pulls. If you have the best legendaries for DPS ({{< item 144295 "Lady and the Child" >}} + {{< item 151802 "Fury of Nature" >}}), you will prefer using those with {{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}} for DPS in mythic+ dungeons, as your DPS with all your CDs up will not be much lower than with {{< spell 102558 "Incarnation: Guardian of Ursoc" >}} and your DPS without CDs will be much higher; but if you do not have one of them, and do have {{< item 137056 "Luffa Wrappings" >}}, you may want to consider using {{< spell 102558 "Incarnation: Guardian of Ursoc" >}} in dungeons instead. To best make use of {{< spell 102558 "Incarnation: Guardian of Ursoc" >}}, you should use it on a large pull when your DPS do not have their cooldowns ready, in order to maximise its usage.



### Level 90

{{< spell 155578 "Guardian of Elune" >}} is ordinarily the best talent. It does not matter if you waste procs - this is irrelevant even in optimal play. To use it optimally, try to ensure that every {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}} and {{< spell 22842 "Frenzied Regeneration" >}} you cast is buffed by {{< spell 155578 "Guardian of Elune" >}} - though naturally sometimes you will need to forego this in order to survive, and that’s fine.

{{< spell 203974 "Earthwarden" >}} is ordinarily not very good. It will provide less mitigation than {{< spell 155578 "Guardian of Elune" >}} in most situations. However, it shines when you are able to hit multiple enemies with {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}}, but are only taking hits from some of them, because they don’t melee you or because someone else is tanking them - such as on Antoran High Command. Even though the main boss ability is not mitigated by {{< spell 203974 "Earthwarden" >}} on Antoran High Command, you can obviously still use {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}}, and it assists with keeping your health high for when you do take that ability.

{{< spell 203965 "Survival of the Fittest" >}} is a minor DPS increase when paired with {{< spell 203953 "Brambles" >}}. It is less than one might think because it makes the cooldown of {{< spell 203953 "Brambles" >}} line up poorly with {{< spell 200851 "Rage of the Sleeper" >}} such that you would be forced to decouple them in order to do the most DPS. It’s very minor, and if survivability is a concern at all, then it is not recommended for these purposes.

{{< spell 203965 "Survival of the Fittest" >}} is generally very weak for survivability. It is only useful (but does become the best talent) if you gain additional casts of {{< spell 61336 "Survival Instincts" >}} throughout the encounter that you actually need in order to survive particular boss mechanics.

### Level 100

{{< spell 80313 "Pulverize" >}} is the best talent for survivability, unless you are using the legendary {{< item 137067 "Elize's Everlasting Encasement" >}}’s Everlasting Encasement. However if you have other survivability legendaries, you should prefer to use those and use {{< spell 80313 "Pulverize" >}} rather than using {{< spell 204053 "Rend and Tear" >}} with {{< item 137067 "Elize's Everlasting Encasement" >}}.

{{< spell 204053 "Rend and Tear" >}} is the best talent for DPS in all situations unless you have {{< item 144295 "Lady and the Child" >}} and {{< item 151802 "Fury of Nature" >}}.

{{< spell 204066 "Lunar Beam" >}} is the best talent for mythic+ dungeons if (and only if) you have both {{< item 144295 "Lady and the Child" >}} and {{< item 151802 "Fury of Nature" >}}, although in raids with these legendaries you would still take {{< spell 204053 "Rend and Tear" >}}.
