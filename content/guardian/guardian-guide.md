## Tanking in General

Your job as a tank is the same as every group member’s job – to do everything you can to help defeat the encounter.

As a tank you will be able to do that in some different ways to other members of your group. You will be responsible for dealing with mechanics designed specifically for your role, but also you will be taking damage from the enemy directly, and it will be primarily (but not exclusively) your responsibility to ensure that you survive that. Like all other raid members, in order to do your job properly, you should do your best not to take unnecessary damage; to focus priority targets; to interrupt things that need to be interrupted; and to do as much damage as possible without causing any other issues as a result.

Some people believe that it is not a tank’s job to do damage. This is absurd. However it is important not to compromise your main job in order to try to do more damage. This is not because it’s important that each player sticks to their own role, but because if you mess up as a tank, you are likely to cause a significant issue for your raid, potentially causing a wipe. You should always do everything you can in order to avoid causing a wipe (at least on progression). This may mean playing over-cautiously, even at the cost of some DPS.

This absolutely does not mean it is never right to gear for, or play for, DPS. An obvious example is, as a Guardian Druid, if you know that you have HoTs on you and you are going to be overhealed anyway, and you already have a couple of {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}} stacks up, you might as well {{< spell 6807 "Maul" >}} rather than casting another stack of {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}} – since it’s additional damage and you are not costing anyone else anything or taking any significant risks. Whether any particular ‘risk’, or ‘tradeoff’ between DPS and survivability, is worth it, is up to you (and your raid leader) to decide. Just remember that if you are causing wipes for any reason – be it lack of concentration, or not doing mechanics properly, or trying to squeeze out more DPS and you thought you could get away with it but you couldn’t – you are playing badly (even if the healers ought to have been able to keep you alive through it!)

Do your best when preparing for a fight to consider the damage patterns, and if you think the encounter is particularly suited to an unusual talent or gear setup which is ordinarily not very good, consider trying it out or asking someone. Particularly for survivability, things can be extremely fight-dependent!

Another, sometimes overlooked facet of a tank’s job is to position the enemy properly. This not only means making sure it’s standing in the right place so that people can do the mechanics properly (such as dragging the boss to the right spot and then taking your spaces at the start of an encounter which requires specific positions), but also means pulling and tanking enemies in a way that makes it easier for the rest of your group. Specifically, it means ensuring that they are not being hit by things that they should not be (which may be their fault, but may also be yours, depending); but also importantly ensuring that you are allowing them to maximise their DPS. This includes not moving when you don’t need to, in order to allow DPS to stand still and cast or for their AoE damage abilities to do as much damage as possible; and when you do need to move, you should do so as efficiently as possible.

It’s also very important for melee DPS to be able to hit a boss from behind – some abilities require this (such as the rogue ability 173458Backstab); but it’s much more significant than merely this – all melee abilities from non-tanks can be parried if an enemy is hit in the front rather than the back, and this is a very significant DPS loss. It is your job to ensure the DPS can safely stand in a place that allows them to do the most DPS.

Particularly in dungeons, you as a tank will generally be the person deciding what enemies are going to be pulled at any particular time. It’s your job to ensure that this is done sensibly – in a way that is something you and your group can handle, but also keeping a reasonable pace, allowing people to DPS efficiently.

If you find yourself losing threat to your other tank, then unless your other tank has significantly better gear than you, or is taunting when they ought not to be, then you are playing badly. This goes for all specs. Note that you generate a very large amount of extra threat on a target for a few seconds after using taunt – try to make sure you do as much damage as possible in that window, and you should have no issues whatsoever. Do bear in mind, however, that if you and your co-tank taunt a target too often in quick succession, it will reduce that window of time for bonus threat, and then eventually be briefly immune to taunting – which can cause a wipe on several bosses.

Tanks cannot be critically hit (unless they are sitting down – don’t do that unless you have a particular reason you want to take more damage). You cannot dodge from behind, so don’t let enemies hit you in the back – if you need to run away from an enemy, run away at an angle, ensuring that it is never hitting you at directly 90 degrees or more from your front. It is also a good idea to ensure that you have the ‘walk backwards’ key bound, as this is often very useful. Be careful with strafing – purely strafing will make you run at a 90 degree angle which can prevent you from dodging. Generally when you need to move enemies immediately you should be strafing or running at an angle of less than 90 degrees; all other minor adjustments to positioning should generally be done by walking backwards.

## Guardian for Beginners

Whilst levelling, don’t worry about what you spend artifact power on. It doesn’t matter; you will have a fully empowered artifact immediately after hitting 110 anyway.

### Main abilities

 - {{< spell 33917 "Mangle" >}} – Single target, generates rage – note that its cooldown can be reset by other abilities.
 - {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} – AoE, generates rage, better than Swipe
 - {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}} – AoE, filler
 - {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} – Generates rage with {{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}} talented, reduces your damage taken via {{< spell 238049 "Scintillating Moonlight" >}}
 - {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}} – Active mitigation, and primary defensive spender. Reduces physical damage taken
 - {{< spell 22842 "Frenzied Regeneration" >}} – Heals you based on damage taken just before using it
 - {{< spell 22812 "Barkskin" >}} – Small defensive cooldown
 - {{< spell 61336 "Survival Instincts" >}} – Large defensive cooldown

### Talents for Beginners

These are not necessarily the best talents to use in any particular situation. They are, however, the easiest.

 - {{< spell 203962 "Blood Frenzy" >}}
 - {{< spell 204012 "Guttural Roars" >}}
 - {{< spell 197632 "Balance Affinity" >}}
 - {{< spell 5211 "Mighty Bash" >}}
 - {{< spell 158477 "Soul of the Forest" >}} ({{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}} if you have {{< item 151636 "Soul of the Archdruid" >}})
 - {{< spell 203974 "Earthwarden" >}}
 - {{< spell 204053 "Rend and Tear" >}}

### Rotation for beginners

Again it must be stressed that this rotation is not necessarily the actual best rotation you ought to be using, either for survivability or DPS, in any particular circumstance. However if you are new to the spec or to the game it will perform adequately for many purposes, and help whilst you familiarise yourself with what your abilities do.

 - {{< spell 33917 "Mangle" >}} on cooldown -> {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} on cooldown -> Use {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} if it’s not up on the target or is about to run out -> {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}}.

 - Make sure all Global Cooldowns are filled by queueing abilities, i.e. press the button just before it’s ready. You should never have gaps in between casts.

 - Use {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}} when you are taking physical damage, and use {{< spell 22842 "Frenzied Regeneration" >}} when you need healing.

 - Use {{< spell 22812 "Barkskin" >}} when you are taking significant damage.

 - Use {{< spell 200851 "Rage of the Sleeper" >}} when you are about to take heavy damage, or as a DPS cooldown if you don’t need it to survive. Note that thanks to an artifact trait ({{< spell 200855 "Embrace of the Nightmare" >}}), you will also do a lot of extra self-healing (particularly when fighting lots of enemies) during Rage of the Sleeper, in addition to the 25% Damage Reduction.

 - Use {{< spell 61336 "Survival Instincts" >}} when you are about to take extremely heavy damage and you are not sure that you will survive without it.

 - Try not to use multiple Damage Reduction cooldowns together unless you think you need to do that in order to survive.

## Gear

Generally, with the exception of trinkets, you will just want to use whatever is the highest item level items you have available.

If you are dying, or taking too much damage, it is because you or members of your group are playing poorly. It is not because of your gear. If your DPS is too low, your gear will be more relevant but it will be a tiny factor compared to the play of again both you and other members of your group.

**Broadly speaking**:

 - For chest/legs/helm - anything more than a 5 item level upgrade will be better. If it’s within 5 item levels, and the lower piece is not versatility/mastery, go with the higher item level item.
 - For Shoulders/Boots/Gloves/Belt - anything more than a 10 item level upgrade will be better.
 - For Bracers/Cloak - anything more than a 20 item level upgrade will be better.
 - Sockets do not make a notable difference for armour pieces for defensive purposes.

**For jewellery**:

 - If it has versatility and mastery, consider it to be +20 item levels. If it has versatility or mastery as the higher stat, or if they’re fairly close together, consider it to be +10. If it has versatility or mastery as the lower stat, consider it to be +5. Sockets are worth ~10 item levels at ~860 average item level or lower; and ~5 item levels at higher average item level.

### Stats

#### Survivability

**Armour (for most physical damage) > Stamina > Versatility > Mastery > Haste > Crit > Agility**

Armour from most of your gear is not the same as armour on trinkets or enchants. The former is increased by {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}}, and the latter is not. Armour is extremely good at reducing physical damage taken. The vast majority of relevant damage when playing the game is physical. Armour does not generally reduce damage taken from bleeds, but there are some exceptions on a boss-by-boss basis (such as Harjatan from Tomb of Sargeras).

Stamina is excellent at increasing your Effective Health. Although this is not useful if you already know you are going to survive and merely want to reduce your damage taken, the caveat “if you already know you are going to survive” is not a useful one when discussing survivability. Stamina is excellent at helping make sure you do in fact actually survive, for example by giving healers more time to heal you, or ensuring you live against spike damage.

Versatility is good for its damage reduction and for increasing your healing done by {{< spell 22842 "Frenzied Regeneration" >}}. Its damage reduction component gets better the more you have. There are no ‘caps’.

Mastery essentially does the same thing as Versatility but worse, and does not affect {{< spell 22842 "Frenzied Regeneration" >}}. It does this by increasing your health and your healing received - which is in effect the same thing as reducing your damage taken.

Haste allows you to use your abilities faster (due to reducing the Global Cooldown and the cooldown of {{< spell 33917 "Mangle" >}} and {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}}, and your autoattacks), so you get more rage. It also reduces the cooldown of {{< spell 22842 "Frenzied Regeneration" >}}.

Agility and Crit both give nothing but dodge (technically Agility gives slightly more absorb from {{< spell 203953 "Brambles" >}}, but this is not a defensive talent); and dodge is an unreliable stat and the amount of it you get is very low per point of Crit or Agility. As such, they are worth almost nothing for survivability.

You cannot realistically sim yourself for survivability. The primary reason for this is that there are no particularly good metrics to measure it by. You can measure your “total external healing required to keep you alive” - the lower, the better - but a tank who has a higher total external healing required to be kept alive may still be a better tank than another, who needs less in total, because they are easier to heal, or survive more reliably. The metric “TMI” can be used to measure spikiness in health, but again this is not useful in isolation.

#### DPS

**Agility > Haste > Versatility > Crit > Mastery**

If you have reasonably good gear (approximately 950-960 on average or higher), and decent Netherlight Crucible traits, then Agility may move below some or all of the secondary stats per point. You can sim yourself for DPS and it can tell you what stats are worth for DPS with your gear. If you don’t know how to do that, there is a guide [here](https://goo.gl/9DxCK0).

### Gems and Enchants

For survivability, use versatility gems. For DPS, sim yourself and use the gems corresponding to whatever your best stat is. Often, versatility will be at least very nearly the best stat for DPS if not the best, so you may just want to use versatility gems to cover both bases. The same applies for ring enchants. Agility is usually the go-to cloak enchant although the Warlords of Draenor versatility enchant is marginally better for survivability.

For neck enchants:
 - Survivability (against physical damage, i.e. most damage) - {{< spell 141908 "Mark of the Heavy Hide" >}}
 - Survivability (against magic damage specifically) - {{< spell 141909 "Mark of the Trained Soldier" >}}
 - DPS (on 1 to approximately 3 targets) - {{< spell 141909 "Mark of the Hidden Satyr" >}}
 - DPS (on 4+ targets) - {{< spell 128551 "Mark of the Claw" >}}

### Trinkets

#### Survivability

See [the defensive trinket guide](https://goo.gl/u7s0nm).

#### DPS

See this [offensive trinket sims chart](https://faideww.github.io/guardian-trinkets/) for a rough outline of what to aim for.  To obtain the most accurate results, you should sim yourself.

#### Pantheon Trinkets

Generally you will want to use a Pantheon trinket (particularly in raids). You have three options - {{< item 154172 "Aman'Thul's Vision" >}} (if you’re lucky enough to get one); {{< item 154173 "Aggramar’s Conviction" >}}; and {{< item 154174 "Golganneth’s Vitality" >}}.

Realistically in raids you will be choosing between {{< item 154172 "Aman'Thul's Vision" >}} and {{< item 154173 "Aggramar’s Conviction" >}}, since you are one of the two members of the raid who can produce the “Tank proc” (the other being your co-tank), which will improve proc diversity and in general boost average uptime on the pantheon empowerment buff for the entire raid. Both defensively and offensively {{< item 154172 "Aman'Thul's Vision" >}} is better than {{< item 154173 "Aggramar’s Conviction" >}} at item level 1000, with the added benefit of dropping at 1000 and not needing to be upgraded.

Outside of raids you have one additional choice. Since {{< item 154174 "Golganneth’s Vitality" >}} provides negligible defensive value, it should only be considered offensively.  On single target at ilevel 1000 and with {{< item 151802 "Fury of Nature" >}} equipped, {{< item 154174 "Golganneth’s Vitality" >}} (despite it having a reduced proc rate and damage for tanks) performs slightly better than {{< item 154173 "Aggramar’s Conviction" >}}, which performs far better than {{< item 154172 "Aman'Thul's Vision" >}} due to the vast majority of {{< item 154172 "Aman'Thul's Vision" >}} value for Guardians being tied into its Pantheon empowerment (which cannot activate outside of raid zones).  In AoE {{< item 154173 "Aggramar’s Conviction" >}} pulls far ahead thanks to {{< item 154174 "Golganneth’s Vitality" >}} split damage.

### Tier

Tier 21 is very weak. It’s not actively harmful and naturally you should use tier items if they are your best items anyway; but it’s generally barely worth considering at all. If you have exceptionally high item level tier 20 or tier 19 gear it may be worth considering defensively, but only if it competes in item level with your other gear. A more detailed analysis of why the tier 21 gear is not particularly good can be found [here]({{< ref "guardian/2018-02-09-guardian-tier-21-analysis.md" >}}).

### Relics

A guide to where relics can be looted, sorted by their default trait, can be found [here](https://goo.gl/KcvnXd).

#### Survivability

Relic item level does not matter for survivability almost at all compared to the traits themselves. All the netherlight crucible traits that give healing are basically worthless for survivability; the only relevant ones are the ones that give stats. Although avoidance is generally negligible (except on certain specific boss mechanics), you get a very large amount of avoidance from the {{< spell 252091 "Master of Shadows" >}} trait, in addition to Mastery, which is a good defensive stat. {{< spell 252088 "Light Speed" >}} is also reasonable defensively.

More important than the secondary traits from the Crucible are the main traits. {{< spell 200399 "Ursoc's Endurance" >}} and {{< spell 238049 "Scintillating Moonlight" >}} are the best defensive traits by far; though {{< spell 200400 "Wildflesh" >}} and {{< spell 200395 "Reinforced Fur" >}} are not very far behind at 3 and 4. {{< spell 200414 "Bestial Fortitude" >}} is okay but not very good. {{< spell 200415 "Sharpened Instincts" >}} and {{< spell 200402 "Perpetual Spring" >}} are negligible.

#### DPS

Generally, {{< spell 200409 "Jagged Claws" >}} is easily the strongest sole DPS trait. However due to the Netherlight Crucible, this does not necessarily mean much in and of itself. Use the [Netherlight Crucible Calculator](https://goo.gl/14pnqz) to work out what your best relics are for DPS.

Alternatively you can use [these strings](https://goo.gl/8JHtxv) for the “Crucible Weights” addon.

### Legendaries

#### Survivability

In order from best to worst:

1. {{< item 137015 "Ekowraith, Creator of Worlds" >}}
2. {{< item 151636 "Soul of the Archdruid" >}}[^1]
3. {{< item 137041 "Dual Determination" >}}[^2]
4. {{< item 132444 "Prydaz, Xavaric's Magnum Opus" >}}
5. {{< item 137025 "Skysec's Hold" >}}
6. {{< item 144249 "Archimonde's Hatred Reborn" >}}[^3]
7. {{< item 144432 "Oakheart's Puny Quods" >}}
8. {{< item 137067 "Elize's Everlasting Encasement" >}}[^4]

[^1]: For fights where the majority of the damage is physical damage (i.e. most fights).

[^2]: For fights where you get an extra use of {{< spell 61336 "Survival Instincts" >}}, at a time where that extra cooldown is relevant - this rarely happens but is very powerful if it does (planned in advance).
[^3]: When you don’t have good trinkets to replace it, the legendary trinket is strong. It can also be used as an “extra cooldown”.
[^4]: If you are using {{< item 137067 "Elize's Everlasting Encasement" >}}, you should (almost) always be using {{< spell 204053 "Rend and Tear" >}}.

The reason why {{< item 137025 "Skysec's Hold" >}} are not as good as they might first appear is that they will often overheal, or otherwise cause other players’ healing to be overhealing when it would have been useful healing.

In dungeons, or in situations where people are not able to heal you much, you will generally benefit more from {{< item 137025 "Skysec's Hold" >}} than {{< item 132444 "Prydaz, Xavaric's Magnum Opus" >}}.

{{< item 144249 "Archimonde's Hatred Reborn" >}} will be more useful than depicted above if you are using it to mitigate a specific boss ability, where it acts as an additional cooldown.

#### DPS

On single target, the best legendary pair is {{< item 151802 "Fury of Nature" >}} paired with {{< item 137067 "Elize's Everlasting Encasement" >}}’s Everlasting Encasement (unless you can make use of {{< item 132452 "Sephuz's Secret" >}}’s proc on cooldown in which case that is stronger than {{< item 137067 "Elize's Everlasting Encasement" >}}, though this is usually not feasible in a raid encounter).

On two or more targets, the best legendary pair is {{< item 151802 "Fury of Nature" >}} combined with {{< item 144295 "Lady and the Child" >}} (only lootable as Balance specialisation). {{< item 144295 "Lady and the Child" >}} changes your rotation significantly (see the rotation sections).

{{< item 144295 "Lady and the Child" >}} is as good as it is because of a bug. This bug has gone unfixed for a very long time (although in 7.3.5 the bug was changed to operate in a slightly different way). The way the bug now works is that if you get a {{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}} proc whilst you already have the {{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}} buff up, the secondary {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} created by the shoulders will be buffed as if it had been a manual cast under the effect of {{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}}, i.e. it will do 300% extra initial damage and generate 8 rage. For this reason, your rotations using {{< item 144295 "Lady and the Child" >}} differ significantly to without (see the rotation sections below for more details).

If you do not have both of the best legendaries and want to know what your best pair is in a particular situation, sim yourself. If you have {{< item 137056 "Luffa Wrappings" >}} and e.g. {{< item 132452 "Sephuz's Secret" >}}, and you do not have {{< item 151802 "Fury of Nature" >}} or {{< item 144295 "Lady and the Child" >}}, then in large aoe situations (such as in mythic+ dungeons) you may want to consider using {{< spell 102558 "Incarnation: Guardian of Ursoc" >}}.

## Utility Abilities

{{< spell 106839 "Skull Bash" >}} – your basic interrupt. Can be used from slightly-further-than-melee-range away from the target (and more, if using {{< spell 197632 "Balance Affinity" >}}).

{{< spell 99 "Incapacitating Roar" >}} – This is an aoe disorient. This is especially useful for stopping enemies from casting when you can’t ordinarily interrupt them, or when there are too many to interrupt all the casts. Note that if you have both the talent {{< spell 204012 "Guttural Roars" >}} and {{< spell 197488 "Balance Affinity" >}}, the range of this ability is enormous, and it can pull enemies from places you were not expecting.

{{< spell 106898 "Stampeding Roar" >}} – Very useful ability in certain raid encounters; and just generally good to have especially in dungeons.

{{< spell 5211 "Mighty Bash" >}} (talent) – Single target stun.

{{< spell 132469 "Typhoon" >}} (talent) – AoE knockback; particularly useful for dungeons where you need to kite the enemies.

{{< spell 102359 "Mass Entanglement" >}} (talent) – AoE root. Usually not very good, but excellent in certain specific situations, such as on Coven of Shivarra or Aggramar, both from the Antorus raid.

{{< spell 200851 "Rage of the Sleeper" >}} – Ordinarily used as a DPS or Survivability cooldown, this ability also (thanks to the artifact trait {{< spell 200855 "Embrace of the Nightmare" >}}) makes you immune to being CC’d if you have it up whilst you are hit with the CC. This is very useful in certain particular dungeon or raid encounters - for example, you can get rid of the whirlwinds that stun on contact from the last boss of Court of Stars by using {{< spell 200851 "Rage of the Sleeper" >}} and running into them; or you can immune the fear from the Felhounds of Sargeras raid encounter by using {{< spell 200851 "Rage of the Sleeper" >}} before it goes on you.

{{< spell 20484 "Rebirth" >}} – Combat resurrection.

{{< spell 5215 "Prowl" >}} – Stealth. Can be useful in some dungeons.

{{< spell 1850 "Dash" >}} – Makes you enter cat form and gives you high movement speed whilst in cat form. You do not need to be in cat form to cast it in the first place.


## Talents

### Level 15

{{< spell 203953 "Brambles" >}} generally provides the highest DPS, since it gives more throughput than the extra {{< spell 6807 "Maul" >}}s you would get from the rage gained through the alternatives. Use it paired with {{< spell 200851 "Rage of the Sleeper" >}}, unless you are using {{< spell 203965 "Survival of the Fittest" >}}, in which case it should be used on cooldown, to maximise DPS.

{{< spell 155835 "Bristling Fur" >}} is generally the best choice for survivability. It generates rage based on damage taken after mitigation, so you will generate a lot more rage if you use it with zero stacks or one stack of {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}} up compared to two or three. It’s best used immediately preceding a period of very heavy physical damage.

{{< spell 155835 "Bristling Fur" >}} hypothetically can be strongest for DPS on single target if you are taking an extremely large amount of damage, and not spending rage on {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}}. This will allow you to generate extra rage for additional casts of {{< spell 6807 "Maul" >}}. However, the benefit from the additional casts of {{< spell 6807 "Maul" >}} is actually quite low unless you are directly replacing a cast of {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}} in your rotation - if you are delaying {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} or {{< spell 33917 "Mangle" >}} then the marginal gain is much lower. You also need to ensure you don’t waste any rage. In practice it is extremely hard, if not impossible, for {{< spell 155835 "Bristling Fur" >}} to beat {{< spell 203953 "Brambles" >}} in terms of DPS.

{{< spell 203962 "Blood Frenzy" >}} can be worth taking when you have several targets within {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} range throughout the entire encounter. It may be worth using on very high fortified mythic+ dungeons, as enemies survive a reasonably long time, and do damage in a constant manner rather than in short bursts. It is generally not worth taking on fewer than 3 constant targets.

### Level 30

{{< spell 204012 "Guttural Roars" >}} is a sensible default option, although note that it will make the range of {{< spell 99 "Incapacitating Roar" >}} so large it may be unusable in dungeons if you are also using {{< spell 197488 "Balance Affinity" >}}.

{{< spell 132302 "Wild Charge" >}} is also very nice as a gap closer. It is exceptionally good if you are using {{< item 132452 "Sephuz's Secret" >}} in dungeons as it will proc from the charge.

{{< spell 236748 "Intimidating Roar" >}} is usually a poor choice. Many enemies can be disoriented by {{< spell 99 "Incapacitating Roar" >}} but not by {{< spell 236748 "Intimidating Roar" >}}, so it actually reduces your utility in those situations.


### Level 45

{{< spell 197492 "Restoration Affinity" >}} is a sensible default option if you are looking for any additional survivability. The healing it provides is rarely operative or overly impactful, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t there.

{{< spell 197488 "Balance Affinity" >}} is probably the most widely used ‘general purpose’ of the three, as it is very nice to have extra range on your melee abilities, particularly for {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} and {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}} in dungeons or certain raid encounters.

{{< spell 202155 "Feral Affinity" >}} is useful for certain situations where the extra movement speed helps deal with a particular mechanic. It is never in practice worth changing into Cat Form to try to do more DPS.

### Level 60

{{< spell 5211 "Mighty Bash" >}} or {{< spell 132469 "Typhoon" >}} will be the most useful depending on what you’re doing, although {{< spell 102359 "Mass Entanglement" >}} is extremely good in certain specific situations.

### Level 75

{{< spell 158477 "Soul of the Forest" >}} is the best talent defensively on exactly one target. If there are two or more targets, and/or you are using {{< item 151636 "Soul of the Archdruid" >}}, then the best defensive talent is {{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}}.

The best talent for DPS is almost always {{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}}.

For extreme burst aoe, {{< spell 102558 "Incarnation: Guardian of Ursoc" >}} is better for that particular period whilst it’s up. Naturally you lose a significant amount of DPS whilst it’s on cooldown, but this may still be worth it depending on your pulls. If you have the best legendaries for DPS ({{< item 144295 "Lady and the Child" >}} + {{< item 151802 "Fury of Nature" >}}), you will prefer using those with {{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}} for DPS in mythic+ dungeons, as your DPS with all your CDs up will not be much lower than with {{< spell 102558 "Incarnation: Guardian of Ursoc" >}} and your DPS without CDs will be much higher; but if you do not have one of them, and do have {{< item 137056 "Luffa Wrappings" >}}, you may want to consider using {{< spell 102558 "Incarnation: Guardian of Ursoc" >}} in dungeons instead. To best make use of {{< spell 102558 "Incarnation: Guardian of Ursoc" >}}, you should use it on a large pull when your DPS do not have their cooldowns ready, in order to maximise its usage.



### Level 90

{{< spell 155578 "Guardian of Elune" >}} is ordinarily the best talent. It does not matter if you waste procs - this is irrelevant even in optimal play. To use it optimally, try to ensure that every {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}} and {{< spell 22842 "Frenzied Regeneration" >}} you cast is buffed by {{< spell 155578 "Guardian of Elune" >}} - though naturally sometimes you will need to forego this in order to survive, and that’s fine.

{{< spell 203974 "Earthwarden" >}} is ordinarily not very good. It will provide less mitigation than {{< spell 155578 "Guardian of Elune" >}} in most situations. However, it shines when you are able to hit multiple enemies with {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}}, but are only taking hits from some of them, because they don’t melee you or because someone else is tanking them - such as on Antoran High Command. Even though the main boss ability is not mitigated by {{< spell 203974 "Earthwarden" >}} on Antoran High Command, you can obviously still use {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}}, and it assists with keeping your health high for when you do take that ability.

{{< spell 203965 "Survival of the Fittest" >}} is a minor DPS increase when paired with {{< spell 203953 "Brambles" >}}. It is less than one might think because it makes the cooldown of {{< spell 203953 "Brambles" >}} line up poorly with {{< spell 200851 "Rage of the Sleeper" >}} such that you would be forced to decouple them in order to do the most DPS. It’s very minor, and if survivability is a concern at all, then it is not recommended for these purposes.

{{< spell 203965 "Survival of the Fittest" >}} is generally very weak for survivability. It is only useful (but does become the best talent) if you gain additional casts of {{< spell 61336 "Survival Instincts" >}} throughout the encounter that you actually need in order to survive particular boss mechanics.

### Level 100

{{< spell 80313 "Pulverize" >}} is the best talent for survivability, unless you are using the legendary {{< item 137067 "Elize's Everlasting Encasement" >}}’s Everlasting Encasement. However if you have other survivability legendaries, you should prefer to use those and use {{< spell 80313 "Pulverize" >}} rather than using {{< spell 204053 "Rend and Tear" >}} with {{< item 137067 "Elize's Everlasting Encasement" >}}.

{{< spell 204053 "Rend and Tear" >}} is the best talent for DPS in all situations unless you have {{< item 144295 "Lady and the Child" >}} and {{< item 151802 "Fury of Nature" >}}.

{{< spell 204066 "Lunar Beam" >}} is the best talent for mythic+ dungeons if (and only if) you have both {{< item 144295 "Lady and the Child" >}} and {{< item 151802 "Fury of Nature" >}}, although in raids with these legendaries you would still take {{< spell 204053 "Rend and Tear" >}}.

## Rotation

### Survivability

The following will only include abilities that are on the global cooldown. You should use {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}} when you are about to take physical damage, and you should use {{< spell 22842 "Frenzied Regeneration" >}} either when it’s going to do lots of healing for you, or when you need to use it to survive. If you are finding it difficult to keep track of {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}}, [this weakaura package](https://wago.io/EJCMTR_PZ) depicts it visually. If you are finding it hard to know when {{< spell 22842 "Frenzied Regeneration" >}} will do a lot of healing, [this weakaura](https://wago.io/NkogH0_D-) displays it well.

#### Without Galactic Guardian

1. {{< spell 33917 "Mangle" >}}
2. Maintain {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} on the target (cast {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} if the dot has less than 4.8 seconds remaining)
3. {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}}
4. {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}}

If you are using {{< spell 102558 "Incarnation: Guardian of Ursoc" >}} and you need additional survivability whilst {{< spell 102558 "Incarnation: Guardian of Ursoc" >}} is up (though you should not take this talent for survivability purposes), then spam {{< spell 33917 "Mangle" >}} during it; whilst maintaining the {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} debuff on any enemies with particularly threatening spike damage.

#### With Galactic Guardian

If the additional rage gained from {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} with a {{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}} proc, compared to whatever your next cast was instead going to be, will cause you to be able to cast {{< spell 22842 "Frenzied Regeneration" >}} or {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}} within your next Global Cooldown, and you would not otherwise have had enough rage to cast it, and you need to cast it within that Global Cooldown or else you will risk dying, then you should cast {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} instead.

If you do not have {{< item 144295 "Lady and the Child" >}} equipped:

1. {{< spell 33917 "Mangle" >}}
