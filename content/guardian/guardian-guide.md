## Tanking in General

Your job as a tank is the same as every group member’s job – to do everything you can to help defeat the encounter.

As a tank you will be able to do that in some different ways to other members of your group. You will be responsible for dealing with mechanics designed specifically for your role, but also you will be taking damage from the enemy directly, and it will be primarily (but not exclusively) your responsibility to ensure that you survive that. Like all other raid members, in order to do your job properly, you should do your best not to take unnecessary damage; to focus priority targets; to interrupt things that need to be interrupted; and to do as much damage as possible without causing any other issues as a result.

Some people believe that it is not a tank’s job to do damage. This is absurd. However it is important not to compromise your main job in order to try to do more damage. This is not because it’s important that each player sticks to their own role, but because if you mess up as a tank, you are likely to cause a significant issue for your raid, potentially causing a wipe. You should always do everything you can in order to avoid causing a wipe (at least on progression). This may mean playing over-cautiously, even at the cost of some DPS.

This absolutely does not mean it is never right to gear for, or play for, DPS. An obvious example is, as a Guardian Druid, if you know that you have HoTs on you and you are going to be overhealed anyway, and you already have a couple of 192081Ironfur stacks up, you might as well 6807Maul rather than casting another stack of 192081Ironfur – since it’s additional damage and you are not costing anyone else anything or taking any significant risks. Whether any particular ‘risk’, or ‘tradeoff’ between DPS and survivability, is worth it, is up to you (and your raid leader) to decide. Just remember that if you are causing wipes for any reason – be it lack of concentration, or not doing mechanics properly, or trying to squeeze out more DPS and you thought you could get away with it but you couldn’t – you are playing badly (even if the healers ought to have been able to keep you alive through it!)

Do your best when preparing for a fight to consider the damage patterns, and if you think the encounter is particularly suited to an unusual talent or gear setup which is ordinarily not very good, consider trying it out or asking someone. Particularly for survivability, things can be extremely fight-dependent!

Another, sometimes overlooked facet of a tank’s job is to position the enemy properly. This not only means making sure it’s standing in the right place so that people can do the mechanics properly (such as dragging the boss to the right spot and then taking your spaces at the start of an encounter which requires specific positions), but also means pulling and tanking enemies in a way that makes it easier for the rest of your group. Specifically, it means ensuring that they are not being hit by things that they should not be (which may be their fault, but may also be yours, depending); but also importantly ensuring that you are allowing them to maximise their DPS. This includes not moving when you don’t need to, in order to allow DPS to stand still and cast or for their AoE damage abilities to do as much damage as possible; and when you do need to move, you should do so as efficiently as possible.

It’s also very important for melee DPS to be able to hit a boss from behind – some abilities require this (such as the rogue ability 173458Backstab); but it’s much more significant than merely this – all melee abilities from non-tanks can be parried if an enemy is hit in the front rather than the back, and this is a very significant DPS loss. It is your job to ensure the DPS can safely stand in a place that allows them to do the most DPS.

Particularly in dungeons, you as a tank will generally be the person deciding what enemies are going to be pulled at any particular time. It’s your job to ensure that this is done sensibly – in a way that is something you and your group can handle, but also keeping a reasonable pace, allowing people to DPS efficiently.

If you find yourself losing threat to your other tank, then unless your other tank has significantly better gear than you, or is taunting when they ought not to be, then you are playing badly. This goes for all specs. Note that you generate a very large amount of extra threat on a target for a few seconds after using taunt – try to make sure you do as much damage as possible in that window, and you should have no issues whatsoever. Do bear in mind, however, that if you and your co-tank taunt a target too often in quick succession, it will reduce that window of time for bonus threat, and then eventually be briefly immune to taunting – which can cause a wipe on several bosses.

Tanks cannot be critically hit (unless they are sitting down – don’t do that unless you have a particular reason you want to take more damage). You cannot dodge from behind, so don’t let enemies hit you in the back – if you need to run away from an enemy, run away at an angle, ensuring that it is never hitting you at directly 90 degrees or more from your front. It is also a good idea to ensure that you have the ‘walk backwards’ key bound, as this is often very useful. Be careful with strafing – purely strafing will make you run at a 90 degree angle which can prevent you from dodging. Generally when you need to move enemies immediately you should be strafing or running at an angle of less than 90 degrees; all other minor adjustments to positioning should generally be done by walking backwards.

## Guardian for Beginners

Whilst levelling, don’t worry about what you spend artifact power on. It doesn’t matter; you will have a fully empowered artifact immediately after hitting 110 anyway.

### Main abilities

 - {{< spell 33917 "Mangle" >}} – Single target, generates rage – note that its cooldown can be reset by other abilities.
 - {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} – AoE, generates rage, better than Swipe
 - {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}} – AoE, filler
 - {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} – Generates rage with {{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}} talented, reduces your damage taken
 - {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}} – Reduces physical damage taken
 - {{< spell 22842 "Frenzied Regeneration" >}} – Heals you based on damage taken just before using it
 - {{< spell 22812 "Barkskin" >}} – Small defensive cooldown
 - {{< spell 61336 "Survival Instincts" >}} – Large defensive cooldown

### Talents for Beginners

These are not necessarily the best talents to use in any particular situation. They are, however, the easiest.

 - {{< spell 203962 "Blood Frenzy" >}}
 - 204012Guttural Roars
 - 197632Balance Affinity
 - 5211Mighty Bash
 - 158477Soul of the Forest (203964Galactic Guardian if you have 151636Soul of the Archdruid)
 - 203974Earthwarden
 - 204053Rend and Tear

### Rotation for beginners

Again it must be stressed that this rotation is not necessarily the actual best rotation you ought to be using, either for survivability or DPS, in any particular circumstance. However if you are new to the spec or to the game it will perform adequately for many purposes, and help whilst you familiarise yourself with what your abilities do.

33917Mangle on cooldown -> 77758Thrash on cooldown -> Use 8921moonfire if it’s not up on the target or is about to run out -> 213764Swipe.

Make sure all Global Cooldowns are filled by queueing abilities, i.e. press the button just before it’s ready. You should never have gaps in between casts.

Use 192081Ironfur when you are taking physical damage, and use 22842Frenzied Regeneration when you need healing.

Use 22812Barkskin when you are taking significant damage.

Use 200851Rage of the Sleeper when you are about to take heavy damage, or as a DPS cooldown if you don’t need it to survive. Note that thanks to an artifact trait (200855Embrace of the Nightmare), you will also do a lot of extra self-healing (particularly when fighting lots of enemies) during Rage of the Sleeper, in addition to the 25% Damage Reduction.

Use 61336Survival Instincts when you are about to take extremely heavy damage and you are not sure that you will survive without it.

Try not to use multiple Damage Reduction cooldowns together unless you think you need to do that in order to survive.

## Gear

Generally, with the exception of trinkets, you will just want to use whatever is the highest item level items you have available.

If you are dying, or taking too much damage, it is because you or members of your group are playing poorly. It is not because of your gear. If your DPS is too low, your gear will be more relevant but it will be a tiny factor compared to the play of again both you and other members of your group.

**Broadly speaking**:
 - For chest/legs/helm - anything more than a 5 item level upgrade will be better. If it’s within 5 item levels, and the lower piece is not versatility/mastery, go with the higher item level item.
 - For Shoulders/Boots/Gloves/Belt - anything more than a 10 item level upgrade will be better.
 - For Bracers/Cloak - anything more than a 20 item level upgrade will be better.
 - Sockets do not make a notable difference for armour pieces for defensive purposes.

**For jewellery**:
 - If it has versatility and mastery, consider it to be +20 item levels. If it has versatility or mastery as the higher stat, or if they’re fairly close together, consider it to be +10. If it has versatility or mastery as the lower stat, consider it to be +5. Sockets are worth ~10 item levels at ~860 average item level or lower; and ~5 item levels at higher average item level.

### Stats

#### Survivability

**Armour (for most physical damage) > Stamina > Versatility > Mastery > Haste > Crit > Agility**

Armour from most of your gear is not the same as armour on trinkets or enchants. The former is increased by 192081Ironfur, and the latter is not. Armour is extremely good at reducing physical damage taken. The vast majority of relevant damage when playing the game is physical. Armour does not generally reduce damage taken from bleeds, but there are some exceptions on a boss-by-boss basis (such as Harjatan from Tomb of Sargeras).

Stamina is excellent at increasing your Effective Health. Although this is not useful if you already know you are going to survive and merely want to reduce your damage taken, the caveat “if you already know you are going to survive” is not a useful one when discussing survivability. Stamina is excellent at helping make sure you do in fact actually survive, for example by giving healers more time to heal you, or ensuring you live against spike damage.

Versatility is good for its damage reduction and for increasing your healing done by 22842Frenzied Regeneration. Its damage reduction component gets better the more you have. There are no ‘caps’.

Mastery essentially does the same thing as Versatility but worse, and does not affect 22842Frenzied Regeneration. It does this by increasing your health and your healing received - which is in effect the same thing as reducing your damage taken.

Haste allows you to use your abilities faster (due to reducing the Global Cooldown and the cooldown of 33917Mangle and 77758Thrash, and your autoattacks), so you get more rage. It also reduces the cooldown of 22842Frenzied Regeneration.

Agility and Crit both give nothing but dodge (technically Agility gives slightly more absorb from 203953Brambles, but this is not a defensive talent); and dodge is an unreliable stat and the amount of it you get is very low per point of Crit or Agility. As such, they are worth almost nothing for survivability.

You cannot realistically sim yourself for survivability. The primary reason for this is that there are no particularly good metrics to measure it by. You can measure your “total external healing required to keep you alive” - the lower, the better - but a tank who has a higher total external healing required to be kept alive may still be a better tank than another, who needs less in total, because they are easier to heal, or survive more reliably. The metric “TMI” can be used to measure spikiness in health, but again this is not useful in isolation.

#### DPS

**Agility > Haste > Versatility > Crit > Mastery**

If you have reasonably good gear (approximately 950-960 on average or higher), and decent Netherlight Crucible traits, then Agility may move below some or all of the secondary stats per point. You can sim yourself for DPS and it can tell you what stats are worth for DPS with your gear. If you don’t know how to do that, there is a guide [here](https://goo.gl/9DxCK0).

### Gems and Enchants

For survivability, use versatility gems. For DPS, sim yourself and use the gems corresponding to whatever your best stat is. Often, versatility will be at least very nearly the best stat for DPS if not the best, so you may just want to use versatility gems to cover both bases. The same applies for ring enchants. Agility is usually the go-to cloak enchant although the Warlords of Draenor versatility enchant is marginally better for survivability.

For neck enchants:
 - Survivability (against physical damage, i.e. most damage) - 141908Mark of the Heavy Hide
 - Survivability (against magic damage specifically) - 141909Mark of the Trained Soldier
 - DPS (on 1 to approximately 3 targets) - 128553Mark of the Hidden Satyr
 - DPS (on 4+ targets) - 128551Mark of the Claw

### Trinkets

#### Survivability

See [the defensive trinket guide](https://goo.gl/u7s0nm).

#### DPS

See [offensive trinket sims](https://faideww.github.io/guardian-trinkets/).

#### Pantheon Trinkets

Generally you will want to use a Pantheon trinket (particularly in raids). You have three options - 154172Aman’Thul’s Vision (if you’re lucky enough to get one); 154173Aggramar’s Conviction; and 154174Golganneth’s Vitality.

Realistically in raids you will be choosing between Aman’Thul’s and Aggramar’s, since you are one of the two members of the raid who can produce the “Tank proc” (the other being your co-tank), which will improve proc diversity and in general boost average uptime on the pantheon empowerment buff for the entire raid. Both defensively and offensively Aman’Thul’s is better than Aggramar’s at item level 1000, with the added benefit of dropping at 1000 and not needing to be upgraded.

Outside of raids you have one additional choice. Since Golganneth’s provides negligible defensive value, it should only be considered offensively.  On single target at ilevel 1000 and with 151802Fury of Nature equipped, Golganneth’s (despite it having a reduced proc rate and damage for tanks) performs slightly better than Aggramar’s, which performs far better than Aman’Thuls due to the vast majority of Aman’Thul’s value for Guardians being tied into its Pantheon empowerment (which cannot activate outside of raid zones).  In AoE Aggramar’s pulls far ahead thanks to Golganneth’s split damage.

### Tier

Tier 21 is very weak. It’s not actively harmful and naturally you should use tier items if they are your best items anyway; but it’s generally barely worth considering at all. If you have exceptionally high item level tier 20 or tier 19 gear it may be worth considering defensively, but only if it competes in item level with your other gear. A more detailed analysis of why the tier 21 gear is not particularly good can be found here: {{< ref "guardian/2018-02-09-guardian-tier-21-analysis.md" >}}.

### Relics

A guide to where relics can be looted, sorted by their default trait, can be found [here](https://goo.gl/KcvnXd).

#### Survivability

Relic item level does not matter for survivability almost at all compared to the traits themselves. All the netherlight crucible traits that give healing are basically worthless for survivability; the only relevant ones are the ones that give stats. Although avoidance is generally negligible (except on certain specific boss mechanics), you get a very large amount of avoidance from the 252091Master of Shadows trait, in addition to Mastery, which is a good defensive stat. 252088Light Speed is also reasonable defensively.

More important than the secondary traits from the Crucible are the main traits. 200399Ursoc’s Endurance and 238049Scintillating Moonlight are the best defensive traits by far; though 200400Wildflesh and 200395Reinforced Fur are not very far behind at 3 and 4. 200414Bestial Fortitude is okay but not very good. 200415Sharpened Instincts and 200402Perpetual Spring are negligible.

#### DPS

Generally, 200409Jagged Claws is easily the strongest sole DPS trait. However due to the Netherlight Crucible, this does not necessarily mean much in and of itself. Use the [Netherlight Crucible Calculator](https://goo.gl/14pnqz) to work out what your best relics are for DPS.

Alternatively you can use [these strings](https://goo.gl/8JHtxv) for the “Crucible Weights” addon.

### Legendaries

#### Survivability

137015Chest > 151636Ring (Soul)[^1] > 137041Ring (DD)[^2] > 132444Neck > 137025Boots > 144249Trinket[^3] > 144432Helm > 137067Elize[^4]

[^1]: For fights where the majority of the damage is physical damage (i.e. most fights).

[^2]: For fights where you get an extra use of 61336Survival Instincts, at a time where that extra cooldown is relevant - this rarely happens but is very powerful if it does (planned in advance).
[^3]: When you don’t have good trinkets to replace it, the legendary trinket is strong. It can also be used as an “extra cooldown”.
[^4]: If you are using 137067Elize, you should (almost) always be using Rend and Tear.

The reason why 137025Skysecs are not as good as they might first appear is that they will often overheal, or otherwise cause other players’ healing to be overhealing when it would have been useful healing.

In dungeons, or in situations where people are not able to heal you much, you will generally benefit more from 137025Skysecs than 132444Prydaz.

144249Archimonde’s Hatred Reborn will be more useful than depicted above if you are using it to mitigate a specific boss ability, where it acts as an additional cooldown.

#### DPS

On single target, the best legendary pair is 151802Fury of Nature paired with 137067Elize’s Everlasting Encasement (unless you can make use of 132452Sephuz’s proc on cooldown in which case that is stronger than 137067Elize, though this is usually not feasible in a raid encounter).

On two or more targets, the best legendary pair is 151802Fury of Nature combined with 144295Lady and the Child (only lootable as Balance specialisation). 144295Lady and the Child changes your rotation significantly (see the rotation sections).

144295Lady and the Child is as good as it is because of a bug. This bug has gone unfixed for a very long time (although in 7.3.5 the bug was changed to operate in a slightly different way). The way the bug now works is that if you get a 203964Galactic Guardian proc whilst you already have the 203964Galactic Guardian buff up, the secondary 8921Moonfire created by the shoulders will be buffed as if it had been a manual cast under the effect of 203964Galactic Guardian, i.e. it will do 300% extra initial damage and generate 8 rage. For this reason, your rotations using 144295Lady differ significantly to without (see the rotation sections below for more details).

If you do not have both of the best legendaries and want to know what your best pair is in a particular situation, sim yourself. If you have 137056Luffa Wrappings and e.g. 132452Sephuz, and you do not have 151802Fury of Nature or 144295Lady and the Child, then in large aoe situations (such as in mythic+ dungeons) you may want to consider using 102558Incarnation.

## Utility Abilities

106839Skull bash – your basic interrupt. Can be used from slightly-further-than-melee-range away from the target (and more, if using 197632Balance Affinity).

99Incapacitating Roar – This is an aoe disorient. This is especially useful for stopping enemies from casting when you can’t ordinarily interrupt them, or when there are too many to interrupt all the casts. Note that if you have both the talent 204012Guttural Roars and 197488Balance Affinity, the range of this ability is enormous, and it can pull enemies from places you were not expecting.

106898Stampeding Roar – Very useful ability in certain raid encounters; and just generally good to have especially in dungeons.

5211Mighty Bash (talent) – Single target stun.

132469Typhoon (talent) – AoE knockback; particularly useful for dungeons where you need to kite the enemies.

102359Mass Entanglement (talent) – AoE root. Usually not very good, but excellent in certain specific situations, such as on Coven of Shivarra or Aggramar, both from the Antorus raid.

200851Rage of the Sleeper – Ordinarily used as a DPS or Survivability cooldown, this ability also (thanks to the artifact trait 200855Embrace) makes you immune to being CC’d if you have it up whilst you are hit with the CC. This is very useful in certain particular dungeon or raid encounters - for example, you can get rid of the whirlwinds that stun on contact from the last boss of Court of Stars by using 200851Rage of the Sleeper and running into them; or you can immune the fear from the Felhounds of Sargeras raid encounter by using 200851Rage of the Sleeper before it goes on you.

20484Rebirth – Combat resurrection.

5215Prowl – Stealth. Can be useful in some dungeons.

1850Dash – Makes you enter cat form and gives you high movement speed whilst in cat form. You do not need to be in cat form to cast it in the first place.


## Talents

### Level 15

203953Brambles generally provides the highest DPS, since it gives more throughput than the extra 6807Mauls you would get from the rage gained through the alternatives. Use it paired with 200851Rage of the Sleeper, unless you are using 203965Survival of the Fittest, in which case it should be used on cooldown, to maximise DPS.

155835Bristling Fur is generally the best choice for survivability. It generates rage based on damage taken after mitigation, so you will generate a lot more rage if you use it with zero stacks or one stack of 192081Ironfur up compared to two or three. It’s best used immediately preceding a period of very heavy physical damage.

155835Bristling Fur hypothetically can be strongest for DPS on single target if you are taking an extremely large amount of damage, and not spending rage on 192081Ironfur. This will allow you to generate extra rage for additional casts of 6807Maul. However, the benefit from the additional casts of 6807Maul is actually quite low unless you are directly replacing a cast of 213764Swipe in your rotation - if you are delaying 77758Thrash or 33917Mangle then the marginal gain is much lower. You also need to ensure you don’t waste any rage. In practice it is extremely hard, if not impossible, for 155835Bristling Fur to beat 203953Brambles.

203962Blood Frenzy can be worth taking when you have several targets within 77758Thrash range throughout the entire encounter. It may be worth using on very high fortified mythic+ dungeons, as enemies survive a reasonably long time, and do damage in a constant manner rather than in short bursts. It is generally not worth taking on fewer than 3 constant targets.

### Level 30

204012Guttural Roars is a sensible default option, although note that it will make the range of 99Incapacitating Roar so large it may be unusable in dungeons if you are also using 197488Balance Affinity.

132302Wild Charge is also very nice as a gap closer. It is exceptionally good if you are using 132452Sephuz in dungeons as it will proc from the charge.

236748Intimidating Roar is usually a poor choice. Many enemies can be disoriented by 99Incapacitating Roar but not by 236748Intimidating Roar, so it actually reduces your utility in those situations.


### Level 45

197492Restoration Affinity is a sensible default option if you are looking for any additional survivability. The healing it provides is rarely operative or overly impactful, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t there.

197488Balance Affinity is probably the most widely used ‘general purpose’ of the three, as it is very nice to have extra range on your melee abilities, particularly for 77758Thrash and 213764Swipe in dungeons or certain raid encounters.

202155Feral Affinity is useful for certain situations where the extra movement speed helps deal with a particular mechanic. It is never in practice worth changing into Cat Form to try to do more DPS.

### Level 60

5211Mighty Bash or 132469Typhoon will be the most useful depending on what you’re doing, although 102359Mass Entanglement is extremely good in certain specific situations.

### Level 75

158477Soul of the Forest is the best talent defensively on exactly one target. If there are two or more targets, and/or you are using 151636Soul of the Archdruid, then the best defensive talent is 203964Galactic Guardian.

The best talent for DPS is almost always 203964Galactic Guardian.

For extreme burst aoe, 102558Incarnation is better for that particular period whilst it’s up. Naturally you lose a significant amount of DPS whilst it’s on cooldown, but this may still be worth it depending on your pulls. If you have the best legendaries for DPS (144295Lady and the Child + 151802Fury of Nature), you will prefer using those with 203964Galactic Guardian for DPS in mythic+ dungeons, as your DPS with all your CDs up will not be much lower than with 102558Incarnation and your DPS without CDs will be much higher; but if you do not have one of them, and do have 137056Luffa Wrappings, you may want to consider using 102558Incarnation in dungeons instead. To best make use of 102558Incarnation, you should use it on a large pull when your DPS do not have their cooldowns ready, in order to maximise its usage.



### Level 90

155578Guardian of Elune is ordinarily the best talent. It does not matter if you waste procs - this is irrelevant even in optimal play. To use it optimally, try to ensure that every 192081Ironfur and 22842Frenzied Regeneration you cast is buffed by 155578Guardian of Elune - though naturally sometimes you will need to forego this in order to survive, and that’s fine.

203974Earthwarden is ordinarily not very good. It will provide less mitigation than 155578Guardian of Elune in most situations. However, it shines when you are able to hit multiple enemies with 77758Thrash, but are only taking hits from some of them, because they don’t melee you or because someone else is tanking them - such as on Antoran High Command. Even though the main boss ability is not mitigated by 203974Earthwarden on Antoran High Command, you can obviously still use 192081Ironfur, and it assists with keeping your health high for when you do take that ability.

203965Survival of the Fittest is a minor DPS increase when paired with 203953Brambles. It is less than one might think because it makes the cooldown of 203953Brambles line up poorly with 200851Rage of the Sleeper such that you would be forced to decouple them in order to do the most DPS. It’s very minor, and if survivability is a concern at all, then it is not recommended for these purposes.

203965Survival of the Fittest is generally very weak for survivability. It is only useful (but does become the best talent) if you gain additional casts of 61336Survival Instincts throughout the encounter that you actually need in order to survive particular boss mechanics.

### Level 100

80313Pulverize is the best talent for survivability, unless you are using the legendary 137067Elize’s Everlasting Encasement. However if you have other survivability legendaries, you should prefer to use those and use 80313Pulverize rather than using 204053Rend and Tear with 137067Elize.

204053Rend and Tear is the best talent for DPS in all situations unless you have 144295Lady and the Child and 151802Fury of Nature.

204066Lunar Beam is the best talent for mythic+ dungeons if (and only if) you have both 144295Lady and the Child and 151802Fury of Nature, although in raids with these legendaries you would still take 204053Rend and Tear.

## Rotation

### Survivability

The following will only include abilities that are on the global cooldown. You should use 192081Ironfur when you are about to take physical damage, and you should use 22842Frenzied Regeneration either when it’s going to do lots of healing for you, or when you need to use it to survive. If you are finding it difficult to keep track of 192081Ironfur, [this weakaura package](https://wago.io/EJCMTR_PZ) depicts it visually. If you are finding it hard to know when 22842Frenzied Regeneration will do a lot of healing, [this weakaura](https://wago.io/NkogH0_D-) displays it well.

#### Without Galactic Guardian

1. 33917Mangle
2. Maintain 8921Moonfire on the target (cast 8921Moonfire if the dot has less than 4.8 seconds remaining)
3. 77758Thrash
4. 213764Swipe

If you are using 102558Incarnation and you need additional survivability whilst 102558Incarnation is up (though you should not take this talent for survivability purposes), then spam 33917Mangle during it; whilst maintaining the 8921Moonfire debuff on any enemies with particularly threatening spike damage.

#### With Galactic Guardian

If the additional rage gained from 8921Moonfire with a 203964Galactic Guardian proc, compared to whatever your next cast was instead going to be, will cause you to be able to cast 22842Frenzied Regeneration or 192081Ironfur within your next Global Cooldown, and you would not otherwise have had enough rage to cast it, and you need to cast it within that Global Cooldown or else you will risk dying, then you should cast 8921Moonfire instead.

If you do not have 144295Lady and the Child equipped:

1. 33917Mangle
2. 77758Thrash
3. 8921Moonfire when you have a 203964Galactic Guardian proc
4. 213764Swipe
