Shadowlands has finally arrived! Nartually theere are many questions to be had so here we go.
# Covenants

**What covenant should I choose?** 

***IT IS IMPORTANT TO STATE THAT EVERY COVENANT WORKS WELL, AND THAT YOU CAN PICK THE ONE YOU PREFER AND NOT GIMP YOURSELF***

* Every covenant is within 5 to 7% of each other depending on the situation (ST/cleave/AOE) (Please refer to the [sims](https://www.dreamgrove.gg/sims/bear/) for more details)

* Night Fae is likely the ideal choice if you are going to Offspec as it is the best for resto and very good for feral, it also offers another burst damage/survivability cooldown, that said in bear form the spell can feel random at times, and you cannot control if you get more damage/surv. You can also use it in other form for more damage or another healing cooldown 

* Necrolord offers one of the best priority damage out of the covenant we have access to, some self healing capabilities if you cast the Swarm on yourself. But will drop off as the target count increases. That is in part mitigated with the soulbind they have access to.

* Kyrian gives you an ability that can give you either strong defensive capabilities/utility or some offensive potential,and, unlike NF you can control which one you get. It can have a few downside (relying on other people, the dps tether acting as a 20% ignore pain and thus can end up wasting a bit of the damage). But unlike necrolord its dps is constant and does not drop off either in ST or AOE. Furthermore Pelagos is still a strong soulbind. 
Important to note that if you can avoid it you should never use the solo bond of the ability as it is inferior to any other benefits.

* Venthyr gives you Ravenous frenzy, which if paired with incarn probably gives you one of the strongest 3 minute burst in the game, has virtually no downside (you have the gcd+2sec before getting stunned while being idle and bears are gcd locked).Venthyr also has access to strong soulbind for ST, where it will struggle a bit more than other covenant.

TLDR; Pick the one you prefer it’s very close and is unlikely to make or break what you are doing 

### Nightfae

**ALERT** Dreamweaver/Podtender is a trap for tanks, it may or may not be a bug but for the time being do not take it!

When the cheat death is activated, all threat is reset thus redirecting every mob you previously had to your group. Whilst in the pod you are unable to be battle resurrected making you watch your group suffer.

*This may be less relevant in raids, but is a big red flag for m+*

### How To Kyrian Tether


First off, your base spell {{< spell 326434 "Kindred Spirits" >}}) (2,5s cast time, only usable in caster form)

You first have to use that spell to either bond yourself with an ally or, if there is no ally around, with yourself. You can change your bonded partner any time.
Depending on the target you did bond yourself to, you gain different active spells, each with a 1 min CD:

__On yourself:__ {{< spell 338018 "Lone Protection" >}}) - 10% less damage taken for 10s.

__On another player:__ First off, 40% of the damage your partner takes for the next 10s is redirected to you (this effect stops after 10s or if you fall below 20% health, {{< spell 327037 "Kindred Protection" >}})

What do you gain in exchange?

*Bonded to a tank*:
You gain also Kindred Protection, so 40% of the damage you'll take will be transferred to your co-tank - except the damage that got transferred from him at the same time. Mind that this only shifts damage and should only be used if one of you is dying to a certain mechanic otherwise.

*Bonded to a healer*: 
For the next 10s you receive 30% of the healing dealt by your bonded parter. {{< spell 327071 "Kindred Focus" >}})

*Bonded to a DPS*: 
For the next 10s you collect 20% of the damage they deal in a pool {{< spell 327022 "Kindred Empowerment" >}}. 
You use this pool to strengthen your damage, your healing and your absorb by 15% for up to 20s after activating this ability (until you used up the pool).
The "absorb" part means that hits against you during that time get reduced by 15% (similar to how "Ignore Pain" from warriors works).

## Legendaries 


**What legendary do I want to build and on which piece?** 

We have a multitude of strong legendary choices, each strong in its own place:


* Defensively:
 
  * Nature’s Order Will (NOW) - Will see use in cutting edge keys and in early raid progression when undergeared. Paired with Survival of the Fittest and Tough as Bark at Rank 7, this allows for 36% uptime on 30% DR  (Drops from Huntsman Altimor, Castle Nathria)

  * Lycara’s Fleeting Glimpse (Lycara's) - Decent Barkskin uptimes, but currently falls victim to the proc happening within the first 45sec of combat and not after 45 sec of combat which makes it a bit unreliable in a dungeon environment though it has *some* potential play for shifting into Owl Form and Starfalling. (Drops from Mordretha, Theater of Pain)

* Offensively:

  * Luffa-Infused Embrace (Luffa's) - Big Thrash Damage, also provides another stack of Rend and Tear. ((Drops from Kryxis the Voracious, Sanguine Depths))

  * Circle of Life and Death (Circle) - If you cat/owl weave it's equal to luffa in ST. (Drops from Stone Legion Generals, Castle Nathria)

  * Draught of Deep Focus (DoDF) - In pure ST, this will be the best leggo offensively for Kyrian and Venthyr. It'll be Best ST option for all convenants if you catweave. If you moonfire, rake, rip, or rejuve more than one target this becomes useless and the effect does not see use. (Drops from The Great Vault)

* Both:

  * Ursoc’s Fury (UFR) - Consistent absorb, more Thrash damage, falls off the higher you push in keys. Most players will not reach the thresh hold where it'll be weaker than NOW. (Drops from Torghast, Coldheart Interstitia, Layer 3+)

*Coldheart Interstitia is in the 3rd week cycle of Torghast wings so we can't get UFR until Dec 8/9th. NOW comes from the raid so that also has to wait until Dec 8/9th.*

***What are you building??***

For M+, most people are aiming for UFR first. It'll be awhile before you'll need NOW. 

For Raid, most are aiming for Draught or Luffa for damage. NOW is generally seen as overkill for raid.

**This does not mean you have to create something else while waiting for those two. Waiting to craft is perfeclty fine, some recommend it as there's still chances of legendary tuning around raid/m+ releases.**

## Threat, Damage, and You

***I am having threat issues what do ???***

**The short answer:** Press thrash and swipe more

**The Long answer:** Above 3 targets anything outside of thrash/swipe is a loss of aoe threat, ie your priority 99% of the time is to spam thrash/swipe on your opener. 
So for your opener, you want to use thrash then 3 swipes then thrash again, rince and repeat, once you have built up threat, you can spread moonfire to the mobs instead of swipe for more damage and ***IF*** you have an issue on one mob don’t hesitate to use MF/mangle on it to get some quick threat.
Another good tip is to wait that all the trash is in range of thrash before pressing it, as it's our best aoe ability and the only uncapped tool we have so you do not want to waste a use early.

**Important to note:** - opening with taunt on single target is highly advised, and Incarn/Zerk will reduce taunt cd to the gcd.
-the cap on swipe is proximity based, so if you have more than five mobs around you can wiggle around to hit different targets with each swipe.

**I Keep hearing about catweaving and Owlweaving, what is it and how do I properly maintain the rotation?**

Simply put catweaving and owlweaving is when you switch forms, when out of harms way, to push out a little bit of extra damaage. 

* **Catweaving:** switch when thrash/mangle is on cd and you have no rage to spend, apply rake, deplete all your energy with shred, and if possible apply rip, switch back to bear, rince and repeat. This rotation is mostly concerning single target.

* **Owlweaving:** push HotW put MF/SF on target cast two wrath cast starsurge, proceed to follow eclipse rotation for the duration of HotW, when out of it, if you have mangle/thrash in cd, if you you have no rage to spend, and if you're going to use swipe, switch to boomy put sunfire on the target, switch back to bear. When in aoe, if you are outside of melee rage you can switch into boomy to put SF on mobs, it is quite solid damage.

PSA: **YOU DO NOT** blow a cd to switch form to do damage, that's a meme thing to do in non relevant content don't do it when progging in raids or pushing in m+

## Simulations

[Shadowlands Bear Sims](https://www.dreamgrove.gg/sims)


As with all generalized charts, these are for informational purposes only and DO NOT accurately reflect your own character. You should ALWAYS use [Raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear) to sim your own character instead of relying solely on general charts like these.

Currently the APL is going to cast convoke in the affinity form you have selected (boomkin affinity > convoke in boomkin); **if you wish to sim with bear convoke please select the restoration affinity talent

The current Basic set up is using Balance affinity and HotW as talents (ergo sims will always use boomkin convoke, and always shift in boomkin form for lycara)
