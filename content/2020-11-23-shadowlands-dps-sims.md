Shadowlands sims are here!

As with all generalized charts, these are for informational purposes only and DO NOT accurately reflect your own character. You should ALWAYS use [top gear @ raidbots.com](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear) to sim your own character instead of relying solely on general charts like these.

<div class="spec-selector" style="width: 50%;">
<a class="spec balance" href="https://balance-simc.github.io/Balance-SimC/">Balance (9.2 PTR)</a>
<a class="spec feral" href="/sims/cat">Feral (9.2 PTR)</a>
  <a class="spec guardian" href="/sims/bear">Guardian (9.2 PTR)</a>
</div>

How to use:

1. Select the fight style from the drop down menu at the top right. ![](/sims/help1.png)
