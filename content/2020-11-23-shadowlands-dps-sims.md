Shadowlands sims are here!

As with all generalized charts, these are for informational purposes only and DO NOT accurately reflect your own character. You should ALWAYS use [top gear @ raidbots.com](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear) to sim your own character instead of relying solely on general charts like these.
