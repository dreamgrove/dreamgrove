  4/- How does SimC handle Kindred Spirits (Kyrian)?

   SimC makes the following assumptions:
        -You are bonding with someone who does the exact same damage as you
        -15% of the pool is lost from taking damage
        -The additional damage done by you AND your partner are attributed to you
  Because The bond also act as a 20% Ignore pain on the damage you take it is very likely that kyrian oversims
  
5/- How does SimC handle Convoke the Spirits (Night Fae)?

    Convoke the Spirits will cast:
        -3 to 5 heals
        -Chance to cast Moonfire if it's not up with a weight of 0.2
        -Chance to cast Iron fur/Mangle with a weight of 0.35
        -Chance to cast thrash with a weight of 0.3
        -20% chance to replace a damage spell with pulverise
        
Future version of the APL will cast feral or moonkin convoke instead of bear convoke depending on the affinity chosen

6/- What about *x* soulbinds ?

  A few traits are performing well while not being simmable currently either due to not being implemented in simc, or due to bugs.
    -Niya's Tools: Burrs will not do any damage to slow-immune mobs, such as bosses.
    -Serrated spaulders (Heirmir, Necrolord) is currently not implemented in simc, but is doing roughly 7 to 10% of a bear damage regardless of target count, making
    it at the very least worth considering
