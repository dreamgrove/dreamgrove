Ferals!
We have decided to ~~totally rip off the boomkins~~ create an ongoing, probably monthly, chat between Me [Guiltyas], Xanzara and possibly various guests for the Dreamgrove.gg site.

We intend to cover a wide array of feral-related topics and hopefully create good discussion/share our thoughts on any relevant feral news. This is our first episode, where we discuss the 7.3 changes to feral and our thoughts on them, what was good and what was less good.
