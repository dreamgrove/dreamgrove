In this (emergency) Cat Chat Xanzara and Guiltyas discuss the 5 minute old feral hotfixes and their notes for the future. 

Quick summary: These are not primarily number changes, they don't intended to buff/nerf us. Its more about gameplay feel. These type of changes would typically occur on PTR or during Betas - it is very rare that Blizzard do these kinds of changes mid-patch via hotfixes. We should probably be grateful that Blizzard is at all willing to make these types of adjustments right now and we look forward to near guranteed "mini-rework" in a future patch.

A tuning pass is still expected after the heroic week like usual.
