In this episode of CatChat we're joined by Nick and Tettles from Moonkin Monthly (also found on Dreamgrove.gg) to talk about who "won" prepatch and some other thoughts on BFA.

With the PrePatch live now and no changes since last episode we thought we'd have a bit of a fun episode with our owl friends and just talk about some of our thoughts on BFA.
