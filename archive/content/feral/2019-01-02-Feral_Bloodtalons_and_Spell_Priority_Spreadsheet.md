***[Spreadsheet Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W1sjoMJJCzVFVnk0L5yDBg30UX2Msio2vF69uLMxlsg/edit#gid=956939905)***

For proper {{<spell 155672 "Bloodtalons">}} usage, you want to buff the abilities that will do the most damage per cast, also known as damage per execute (DPE). In a single target scenario, this is easily done by using it on your finisher and {{<spell 1822 "Rake">}} (which will be your second most damaging ability). However, with more targets the priority will change.

This spreadsheet will provide both the DPE and damage per energy (DPR) for all abilities including talents. You can use the {{<spell 202031 "Sabertooth">}} and {{<spell 158476 "Soul of the Forest">}} (SotF) dropdown menus to select whether or not you are using those talents.

There are multiple ways you could use the information provided in this spreadsheet, but the two main usages are for:

1. Prioritizing {{<spell 155672 "Bloodtalons">}} to buff the most damaging abilities at a certain target count

2. Priotizing abilities with a higher DPR first (general usage, not specifically with {{<spell 155672 "Bloodtalons">}})

*Note that due to {{<spell 285381 "Primal Wrath">}} doing a lot of damage, the data points on the chart will be out of the vertical axis bound - in other words it is very good for AoE.*

**Azerite traits are not included in this spreadsheet**

One helpful rule of thumb that can be taken from this spreadsheet is to use {{<spell 285381 "Primal Wrath">}} in place of {{<spell 22568 "Ferocious Bite">}} at 2+ targets without {{<spell 202031 "Sabertooth">}}, and 3+ with {{<spell 202031 "Sabertooth">}} just for its initial hit damage.
