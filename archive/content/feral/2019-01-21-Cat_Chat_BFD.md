In this Episode of Cat Chat we look at the upcoming new raid, Battle for Dazarlor, discuss new traits, how the 8.1 changes have turned out in regards to talent balance (Small Sabertooth Rant), and talk about what we think optimal setups will be.

Apologies for the delay in schedule but with BOD on the horizon we should be back to the normal monthly schedule going forwards.
