### General Feral Opener Sequence

## Note about openers
An opener is not a big part of your dps. To most this might be immediately obvious, but a lot of people tend to vastly overrate the importance of a good opener. With that caveat out of the way, here is the current reference opener which we intend to keep up-to-date through the expansion. If you have any ideas about how to improve this opener, feel free to contact me. This opener is a intended to be generally useful, but obviously there might be niche situations where something else is better.

**If you are a novice at feral, I'd strongly recommend starting with a guide aimed at novices as opener optimizations are completely useless effort before you are atleast an intermediate feral**
