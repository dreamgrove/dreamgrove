In this episode of CatChat, we go over the current state of Feral on the beta with our first guest!
Night of HC (Burning Legion-US)

We discuss (and rant a bit) about the current state of changes,
just how much we dislike the GCD change with regards to Tigers Fury, our opinion of Tigers Dash,
and much more in the second ever episode of Cat Chat.
