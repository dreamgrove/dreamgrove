Been a hot minute since you last saw one of these, with probably the biggest change to the spec ever going live with the Dragonflight Prepatch we decided to get togther in lucky number episode 13 we make a bit of a return to have a (not so) brief discussion about the key talents in the dragonflight feral talent tree.

We're both extremely excited for this iteration of feral and hope you enjoy listening to us. Bear with us a little we appear to be a tiny bit out of practise!
