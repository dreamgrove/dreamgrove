In this episode of CatChat (Which is a little late sorry), we discuss Feral's AOE going into BFA and how we feel about it.

We discuss (and rant a bit) about AOE, Utility and our concerns for Mythic+, as well as some discussion about tuning (which who knows could fix everything). With the added bonus of our views on the new animations in the third episode of Cat Chat!
