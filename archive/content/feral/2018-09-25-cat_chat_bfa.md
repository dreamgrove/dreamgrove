In this Episode of Cat Chat we look at changes in 8.1 PTR and some brief discussion of yesterday's Azerite hotfixes. It's important to note as we do in the video but these changes are datamined, and as such they're not final. If you have any feedback please submit it on the forums!

Datamining can be found [here](https://www.wowhead.com/news=287352/patch-8-1-ptr-27826-class-changes-elemental-shaman-feral-druid-talents)
