10.1.5 Changes

>A new talent, "Rising Light, Falling Night," increases your damage and healing by 3% during the day and increases your Versatility by 2% at night.

<br>As most people are raiding at night this will just be a 2% Versatility increase, you will never not take this talent.
<br>Anything about instances always being "day" is not accurate, it's just dependent on the server-time.


>Lunar Shrapnel was redesigned. Starfall now deals 20% increased damage and is a 1 point talent.

<br>Will probably not see much play outside of sustained AoE fights and big pull dungeons


>Wild Surges bonus to Wrath and Starfire critical strike chance was reduced to 12% from 15%.


>Astral Smolder duration was reduced from 8 seconds to 6 seconds.

<br>Stellar flare is basically neutral to Astral smolder but the max dps of Astral Smolder is higher, meaning there is no real reason to talent out of it.


>Increase in New Moon, Half Moon, and Full Moon Damage
<br>New Moon damage increased by 100%.
<br>Half Moon damage increased by 45%.
<br>Full Moon damage increased by 15%.

<br>Moons will now be a contender for Single target, ~1% ahead of Fury of Elune


>Fury of Elune Changes
<br>Radiant Moonlights Fury of Elune cooldown reduction is now 15 seconds (was 20 seconds).
<br>The damage caused by Fury of Elune was reduced by 10%.

<br>Will still be used for any multi-target scenario over Moons, this also means that cancelling pulsar will not be as benificial since Fury of Elune doesn't line up regardless.


>Warrior of Elune now starts its cooldown as soon as it's activated, but the bonuses to your next 3 Starfires must be used within 25 seconds.

<br>Makes you have to think a bit when you use it so that you actually utilize all charges


>Umbral Intensity now increases damage dealt by Wrath by 20% per point (was 10%) and the damage Starfire deals to nearby targets increased by 15% per point (was 10%).

<br>Probably won't see much play as there are better talents to choose from and it doesn't enable any interesting pathing in the talent tree


>Nature's Grace now only triggers after an Eclipse ends, not when extending an Eclipse with Celestial Alignment. This change brings a new dynamic to the utilization of Eclipse during combat.

<br>Doesn't really help with anything, makes you not want to extend incarn with pulsar if possible

 
>All spell damage dealt by Balance Druids was increased by 5%.


>Waning Twilight's damage and healing were increased to 10%, up from 8%.
