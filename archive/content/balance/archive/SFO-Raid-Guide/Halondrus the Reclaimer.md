## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenant: 50/50 ven nf split depending what u like more both are fine.
- If you can get your raid to delay the Bloodlust in P3 a bit you can use everything on cooldown and get 3 uses. Otherwise save CDs for P3.
- In the intermissions really try to maximise your time spend casting by positioning yourself well and using Starfall whenever you need it.
- Barkskin on cd and if you have it up on Reclaim casts.

## Mythic only notes:
- Covenants: NF or Venthyr
- Prog cds: pull/p3 in lust (only p3 dmg matters, but if you somehow do not have enough damage for the push you want you can do p1/p2/p3 on cd)
- Barkskin: 2 usages every phase, use on random missiles then on reclaim. Just feel out whenever you have to skin misslies (usually if u do 2 orbs or have bomb in missile)
- Bear Form: If you have bomb on you (or want to soak more than one orb) and missiles will hit > pre bear form the missile impact. Take Ursine Vigor if venthyr and you have Guardian Aff. 
- If you will 100% get hit by a missile aftershock for whatever reason you can survive it with Ursine Vigor from around 60% hp. Hotw if available and hp pot before to make sure you do not die to this.
- Obviously use Stellar Drifts in intermissions.
- If you carry a bomb in intermissions, try to not stack with other bombs. Play in front of the group if you can, max range from boss. Make sure to swap bomb pickup before knockbacks and use them to your advantage.
