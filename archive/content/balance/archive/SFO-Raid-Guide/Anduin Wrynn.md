## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenant: Venthyr is insanely strong here, but NF is also playable. 
- Barkskin every 2nd Hopebreaker
- Incarn pull/LK1/LK2/end if possible
- For LK venthyr ramps I started at 10 sec left on the 2nd abomination spawn. (this was with sinful no tier)

## Mythic only notes:
- Covenants: Venthyr, if you really want to play nf, do the chinese korayn tech
- CDs: Pull / LK1 / LK2 / end if possible, if you get 4th cd use sigil+pot on cds 2/4, if you only get 3, use sigil/pot on 1/3. Use LK cds right before either bloodlust ends (for cube) or 2nd monstrous spawns
- Barkskin: Try to do on Hopebreakers, of if you get debuff on you. You can also play tough as bark instead of Innate Resolve. Keep one for intermission so you do not get your casts pushed back inside cds.
- Cyclone tech: Cyclone add 4 and add 6 of the sets at between 2 and 4 sec remaining until kingsmourne, depending how fast the tank moves anduin on top of the add. If you have to Solar Beam out of your cyclone, you have to beam after the cyclone ends, otherwise the add will not get silenced. 
- You can knock an add in downstairs phase with door>cat form>wc>typhoon>priest knock and it makes it very easy for the dk to grip it
- If possible line up your pulsar with downstairs phases.
