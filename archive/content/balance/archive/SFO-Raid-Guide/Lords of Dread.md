## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenant: Venthyr is a bit better than NF, but both are playable nonetheless.
- Barkskin if any mechanic touches you and on the raidwides.
- Starfall on cd :)

## Mythic only notes:
- Literally hc version but now you have to actually bait sleep puddles
- CDs: 47sec / 5:44 if only 2cds OR 47 / 3:50 / 7:44 if 3cds (depends how fast u reduce boss hp bar to 0)
- Dont die????
