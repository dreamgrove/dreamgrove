## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenants: Ven and NF playable
- Always starfall the quasars.
- Barkskin on cd, not useful on many mechanics, maybe keep for intermissions.

## Mythic only notes:
- Covenants: Venthyr, but NF is not bad here if you use convoke when quasars are not spawned (very hard)
- CDs: pull / on cd in intermission / on cd last phase
- Barkskin when 1st quasar sets spawn in every phase and in intermission (depends which orb you skin on your healer cds and on hymn timings but try to skin 1st to get it back for 1st quasars)
- If you are playing more than one balance druid only use 1 starfall on the first set of quasars. 
- The quasars spawn from the blue arrows on the ground. The boss will be positioned in between two arrows. The boomies will knock the quasars that spawn 2 arrows left and right of the current boss positioning. The meta right now is shining force 1st set into boss and typhoon 2nd set away from boss. 
- Your hp bar will drop very fast on prog especially make sure to heal yourself especially in intermission.
