## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenant: Venthyr will generally outperform NF here as it is really strong for P3 and the cardinal adds. The only upside Night Fae has is that it can more often burst down add spawns.

- All 4 ritual adds are Starfall cleavable at the start if you stand in the middle. Once you can't stand in the middle anymore, go towards the back of the room and hit the 3 adds where the boss is not standing. One add should be stacked on boss so the melee can cleave it down.
- Barkskin the Night Hunters and the spread. 

## Mythic only notes:
- Mythic is highly dependant on your comp and what your role in it is. You will have to either completely destroy the ritual adds or just help cleave them down and focus more on boss dmg. I will try to explain what to do for both situations. 
- Covenants: Ven or NF, I played both and personally feel like Venthyr is better for both jobs unless you need exactly a pulsar proc convoke for the p3 ritual adds in order to kill them (which can be the case). 
- Hotw Resto aff heal in 2nd intermission and coat raid with rejuvs to let healers drink.
- As a moonkin you will likely be put on back add janitor duty, which means you have two choices: either cleave all 3 back adds with starfall and ramp or focus more on boss dmg by only helping one side and trying to cleave the bosses with your first starfall. I recommend full dotting all the 3 ranged adds while the shields are still on them, then starfall when shield is down if you go for heavy add dmg. If you do not need so much add dmg, you can dot your 2 adds, then start ramping 1-2 globals after night hunters go out. If you are targeted by a night hunter, especially the one on the oposite side of the room, try to use door to get to your add and dot one of the side ones while you are on your way. After you broke the shield wc towards the middle of the room and take the gateway towards your add. At that point you can start ramping and trying to move towards the boss with stellar drift.
