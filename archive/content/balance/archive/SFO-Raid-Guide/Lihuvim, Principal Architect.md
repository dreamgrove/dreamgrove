## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenant: Either covenant works here and which one you want depends on what kind of damage you are missing. You will not be able to burst down the intermission adds, but Frenzy is far superior when you need more damage for after intermission.
- Barkskin every intermission.
- CDs either after intermissions or on CD for boss this is very dependant on your group. Start with holding for after first intermission then go from there. Try to use CDs with Bloodlust.

## Mythic only notes:
- Covenant: Night Fae prefered, Venthyr might work out if you do some weird timings but i would not recommend trying. 
- If you have to keep an add rooted far away from the main group position good luck, you will need it.
- If needed you can use Human Form Wild Charge instead of Moonkin Form in order to travel more distance.
- Have skin for push/pull and intermissions, but the dmg intake on this fight is pretty low.
- Intermission windows (especially the first one) should look something along these lines: Starsurge, Starsurge, (proc pulsar) Convoke, SS, SS, HM, SS, FM, SS. With this you might not get all of your casts in, but it is the safest route. I left out the Half Moon and only Full Mooned. 
- CDs:
<br> Inc: Pull / after 2nd intermission / Lust
<br> Convoke: 1st Prototype, 2nd Prototype, 3rd Prototype, end
<br> Pulsar: This will have a very tight window and might not be achievable without 4pc. 1st Prototype, p2, 2nd Prototype, p3, 3rd prototype, p4. Try to get convokes in with your prototype Pulsars while trying to get as close to a pulsar proc as possible in the intermissions. Might sound easy but its not.
