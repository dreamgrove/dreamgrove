## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenant: Venthyr can give more damage but it really doesn't matter here.
- Pad AoE fiesta with a single target burst phase at the end. Have fun and try to pad more than the others. 

## Mythic only notes:
- Covenant: Venthyr can give u more raw damage although I do see NF being better survivability wise as on mythic you can probably cancel a cast and soulshape if someone is trying to hunt you with the yellow arrows or you get boxed, as door is too slow of a cast for this boss to actually dodge any mechanics. Door is not at all useless though. It can be used as a repositioning tool although its effect is diminished by Stellar Drift.
- While progressing this boss you have to keep in mind that this is a grindable fight in the sense of you being able to kill it while having half of the raid dead. Play as safe as you can as most mechanics oneshot or do 80% of your hp bar. 
- Aggro is a big issue on this fight and you can get meleed very fast on this fight. If you have a paladin at your disposal, their bop is yours. Make sure to keep an eye on that and call out for it especially when new adds are coming up and you are inside cds.
- Barkskin almost on cd, but make sure to have one for heat phases.
- Do not forget that if you have a paladin in your raid, you can ask for a BoP if you have aggro.

## Talents:

{{< talents spec="balance" src="live" recommend="311,113,133,223,313,231,232" >}}

Row3: Here you can run Resto Aff for the vortex, if not Guardian Aff is more overall DR and helps you survive the spiky dmg patterns and maybe a oneshot mechanic or two if you are lucky.
<br>Row5: If you feel like more aoe is needed, pick sotf, if not then default to inc.
<br>Row6: As much as I would like to say tm is good here, the movement from SD is very good here as you need to instantly dodge some mecahnics and you can not afford to finish most casts as everything oneshots. TM might become a valid choice on farm.
<br>Row7: Arguably the only fight you could play sol on, even though it is still probably not the go to. If your adds are permanently spread and you are playing NF, it might be the correct choice but that is still a bit of a stretch, otherwise pick FoE. If you are somehow lacking ST, pick NM as NF.
