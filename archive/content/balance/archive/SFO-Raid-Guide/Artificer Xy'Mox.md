## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenants: If you are required to do more damage in the intermissions Venthyr is a clear winner. Otherwise both perform Venthyr and NF perform similarly.
- Barkskin on cd on the spread circlces and in intermission in case u get fixated by the beams. There is nothing particularly threatening.


## Mythic only notes:
- Covenants: Venthyr or NF, this is mostly a personal preference or a "whatever sims higher" scenario. 
- On mythic your role is a ST bot. Full focus boss and do damage. 
- If you are even slightly out of position make sure to use Door or Soulshape on the rings. 
- CDs: Pull / on CD somewhere in P2 around 65% boss hp (this will line with rings most likely), this can be delayed but keep in mind that the boss phases at 50% / Lust

## Soulbinds:

## Talents:

- SD for all covenants and maybe FoE for Kyr and NF aswell.
- You could run Might Bash if you feel like you really need stuns in the intermission, but this should be covered by aoe stuns.
- If you feel really confident in your movement, StFl can also be picked as a bit of a boost in boss damage.
