## Notes For the Boss:
- Covenant: Both NF and Venthyr are playable but neither have an edge. Which one pulls ahead will depend on kill time.
- As NF be careful to not stand too far away from the boss as its range is counted from the center of the bosses hitbox unlike all other spells. 
- Try to not kill your melee by standing too close to the boss and baiting a puddle where they want to move.

## Mythic only notes:
- Covenants: NF but Venthyr is also playable without that much of a loss, but I would recommend against it as this is a hard enrage fight. This is the worst possible timer for venthyr. (6:05 kill or be killed)
- Try to optimise your movement as much as possible and think at least 15sec ahead what your movement pattern will be. How you move will highly depend on your raid.
- Barkskin the soaks and burrows on cd if possible.

## Talents:

- If you have troubles with movement, talent Stellar Drift and use Starfall whenever you need it, although I do not recommend it as you need every single bit of damage possible.
- Guardian Affinity will have increased value because of the bursty dmg pattern and because you will not be casting any healing spells unless that means you die.
