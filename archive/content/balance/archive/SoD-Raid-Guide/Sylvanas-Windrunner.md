## Notes For the Boss:

P1:
- Whenever chains drop make sure to pool up enough AP for one Starfall. You can almost ignore the chains assuming there isnt one very far away and just continue your rotation on the boss. Make sure to position yourself in the middle of the chains if possible in order to hit all of them with your Starfall.
- Use Barkskin if you are being targeted by a chain far away or whenever you are away from the group for tank Black Arrow hits.
- Use Roar at the group wide chains right before P2 or wherever assigned.

P2: 
- Roar the bridges before vulnerable and add phases. Alternate between 2 roars if possible.
- Use Incarn right as Sylvanas becomes vulnerable. At the 2nd vulnerable phase it might be beneficial to either use Inc early or hold altogether.
- Use Dash, Wild Charge and Door of Shadows on bridges.

P3:
- Pick a spot on the platform and go there every pull. That should be the case with everyone in your group in order to make movement easier.
- If you Bloodlust on the 2nd platform, use cds there and at the very end.
- You can survive 4th platform raze at the end for a bit.
- You can use Starfall if you are far from the next platform and are targeted by Black Arrows.

## Mythic only notes:
P1: 
- On pull pool up to 100ap before using Inc/RF in order to assure that you have the Hysteria window for the chains and you can commit 2-3 starfires into one group of chains while having Starfall up.
- With your first Inc try moving with 1x Starsurge for the first set of puddles and for the 2nd one with 2x redot.
- Your FoEs should line up for sets of chains. Try to use them on one of the packs instead of the boss. 
- Make sure to have Starfall for every set of chains and if your Lunar Eclipse lines up use Starfires on them.
- Use Stampeding Roar on the Veils if assigned.
- Barkskin Shadow Daggers or chains.

Intermission:
- Make sure to ALWAYS have 100ap when coming into the intermission.
- You can precast RF/Inc right when veil appears into a Stampeding Roar to give your group mobility if you are able to. This also grants you 2 RF stacks for 1 global spent. Try to cover the group with Rejuvs to ramp, but make sure to not oom yourself as you need mana for decurse spam. 
- You can use Heart of the Wild after the last sentinels die and start rejuv covering the group if your HotW is not assigned anywhere else before P3.
- Before the chains spawn try to place yourself in such a manner than you either get gripped by the SIDE chain or the FAR chain groups. This allows you to move between the far, side and middle chain groups and lets your Starfall carry the raid. 
- Use your FoE either on the far or the middle chain group if possible.
- Save Barkskin for these chains.

P2:
- Your cds will mainly depend on your assignments here, either on boss vulnerable phases or on adds.
- If you are on Summoner sides make sure to decurse.
- Most of the time its worth using Moonfire on the big adds.
- Barkskin either Shadow Daggers or Crushing Dreads.

P3: 
- Barkskin every Banshee's Fury
- Use Inc right after the 2nd platform Veils, right before soaks and you should be able to use its full duration. The 2nd one should be used with Bloodlust after the Veil on 4th platform.
- If someone dies on another platform their corpse will be teleported onto the current one after every Raze.
- You can use Heart of the Wild before the Black arrows on either 3rd or 4th platform.
