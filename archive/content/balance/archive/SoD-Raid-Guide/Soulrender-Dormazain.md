## Notes For the Boss:
- You can use Wild Charge, Soulshape, Door of Shadows, redots, Starsurge or Starfall for Dance. 
- Use Barkskin on chain breaks.
- Fully dot the adds if they do not die too quickly, if they do then only sunfire them.

## Mythic only notes:
- Hold your second FoE for add cleave with Bell.
- Always use Starfall the adds.
- Try to be close to the adds you are targetting for debuff swaps. They are usually right after the big add spawns. Keep in mind that after they expire they will be reapplied to other people as long as you are not in a dance window. If adds are up and you get a debuff your job is to double debuff them. 
- You can basically use Incarn on cooldown. You will get 3 usages in the fight.
- Try to do not do the 2nd and 5th chain break, as they line up with your cds. If you for some reason are supposed to break 2nd or 5th just hold your cds for after them.
- Use Guardian HotW + Barkskin whenever you are breaking your chain.
- Be very careful of puddles especially on chain breaks if you are standing inside AMZ/Barrier, as they are VERY hard to see sometimes.

## Soulbinds:

<br>[Night Fae](https://ptr.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/night-fae/niya/druid/AwCW5b4CBTXKCCU1IAgTBTXGCBUy5AglMuIIIhUySQgldgAI)

## Talents:
- SD is especially potent on adds because of the debuff circles and offers a lot of mobility for no downtime inside dance.
- I would recommend FoE even as Night Fae because of the debuff circles on the adds.
