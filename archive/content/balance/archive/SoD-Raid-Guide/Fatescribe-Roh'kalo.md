## Notes For the Boss:
- This is one of the bosses where you should focus on doing the mechanics more than doing damage if you are able to control the runes. 
- A Single Target boss with multiple adds in the intermission. Stellar Drift and Fury of Elune are highly recommended here. Line your 2nd and 4th Fury of Elune with the 2nd add splits in the intermissions. It's preferred to hold FoE for when you need it (using only 2 FoE instead of 3 every Incarn cycle), especially if Venthyr.
- Use Door of Shadows for orb drops. Try to make space for others if needed. If you are blocked off by someone else you can use 2 Doors and hop behind them if you do it fast enough.
- Wild charge and Stampeding roar aggressively if beams spawn on you and/or your group.


## Mythic only notes:
- Cds especially on progress should be used on boss in P1/P2/P3. 
- Use Barkskin on every mechanic. 
- If you make a mistake and soak a beam from runes or an add cast in intermission forfeit doing damage and try to repair your mistake immediately by healing yourself even if you are close to full hp. You will tick down very fast and pressure the healers even more. 
- Just play mechanics :)
