## Notes For the Boss:
- Try to pick up powers such as Potent Acid Gland, Huddled Carvings or Elethium Weights. If those are not avaiable take the "budget" versions like Ten of Towers or Obleron powers. Oddly Intangible Key is also pretty potent if you are new to the fight, as your first Ravenous Frenzy will line up with Hungering Mist and you can just stand still and tank it with this power.
- Door of Shadows and Soulshape are usable whenever you get unlucky with the safe spot spawns and use wild charge aggressively.

## Mythic only notes:
- For your first time around try to take defensive Anima Powers such as Unstable Form, as it is incredibly useful for soaking puddles and aleviates a lot of pressure from your healers.
