## Notes For the Boss:
- You can use Wild Charge and Soulshape if badly positioned in order to stop the knockback from the dispells.
- Door of Shadows is usable whenever you need to get into position for dispells.


## Mythic only notes:
- Assuming that the Mass Dispell strat is being used, you will have to stop the knockback by using either Wild Charge, Soulshape or a Stellar Drifted Door of Shadows. In my personal opinion the difficulty of the kockback cancels goes as follows from easiest to hardest: <br>Moonkin WC >> Bear WC > Soulshape > Human WC > SD Door
- Use Barkskin on Shatters. The first Barkskin can be used right before the first knockback if you are pushing right after. Try to look out for dots on you as they do the most damage in this fight. They put a lot of pressure on healers if the orbs are not killed in time. Be very careful if you have a dot and get a shatter or knockback right after.
- Be very careful on and after third shatter. Do not hesitate to use a regrowth or Guardian HotW if it means keeping you alive. Try to hold HS and HP pot for that point.
- You can also help with orb carrying if you have Door of Shadows up.

## Soulbinds:

## Talents:
- You can run a full ST setup changing between FoE and Moons depending on covenant. 
- SD is very strong here as you can help take down orbs faster and orb control is the most important part of the fight. Although after the nerfs to orb hp STFL is also playable on hc and normal if the orbs die too fast or the boss generally dies too fast.
