## Notes For the Boss:
- You can use Door of Shadows/Soulshape in order to skip the Spiked Balls. This is very useful if you are chained.
- You can Wild Charge off the platform and back onto it in order to dodge the Spiked Balls or Spikes in intermission.
- Front of the Pack is a must for the intermission.
- It is always worth to starfall Spiked Balls damage wise, as you are 2 target cleaving and you get some free movement on top of that.

## Mythic only notes:
- Be very careful if you get chains in P2. You can get boxed VERY fast if you are not careful. Try to always use Door if you are chained and always use starfall for movement if necessary especially if you are not in P3 as damage in P2 and P1 does not matter. You will stop for timings no matter what.
- You can Door of Shadows/Soulshape or Wild Charge off the edge and back on platform in the intermission for the spike skips.
- Always try to help with healing and try holding resto HotW until the second intermission as the damage is basically doubled there.

## Talents:
- SD is the go to here even if you do not need it for movement.
- Restoration Affinity + HotW is recommended as you can help out healing while moving in the intermission.
