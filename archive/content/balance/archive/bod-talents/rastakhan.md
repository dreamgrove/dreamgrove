<b>Notes</b>

This boss starts out quite cleave heavy but eventually leads to multiple single target damage checks. What this means is you have a choice to make in the tier 90 talent row, weighing Stellar Flare vs Twin Moons based on how much multi target damage you need. Make sure to pool Astral Power to burst down the totems spawned throughout the fight.

<b>Notes</b>

Pick Stellar Flare for phase 3 damage if you will be attacking Bwonsamdi as this phase is truly all that matters in terms of killing the boss. Always save your 2nd set of cooldowns for phase 3. Make sure to pool Astral Power before Inevitable Demise to minimize downtime and be in position to drop Deathâ€™s Doors in the proper spot to prepare for phase 3.
