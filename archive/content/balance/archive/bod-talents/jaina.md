<b>Notes</b>

Though mostly a single target focused fight, Jaina has multiple instances of add spawns, with the important add spawns being singular and needing high priority damage. It is ideal to have your cooldowns ready for the Wall of Ice towards the end of Phase 2. Making use of Restoration Affinities healing is a powerful strength in our kit, as the ticking damage through the fight can potentially be very threatening to your raid. Due to the high movement of this fight, Warrior of Elune is the fitting choice for our Tier 15 talent row if it's needed.

<b>Notes</b>

Phase 1 can be quite erratic and relies mostly on reacting to whichever mechanics come your way. Besides reacting to whatever situation Jaina puts you in, it's important you use Wild Charge and Warlock portals to return to safety after Avalanche. After accumulating Chilling Touch stacks and also right before Ring of Ice goes off, you should quickly step in and out of the fire on the ground to negate the effects completely. Make sure to save your cooldowns, and also ensure that you are at a decent amount of Astral Power before phasing so that you can deal priority damage during the incoming intermission.

Phase 1 intermission is a simple phase in which you must kill the Icebound Images as fast as possible while dodging the approaching mechanics at all costs. We recommend that you simply cast only instant cast spells on these images as they are frail and don't require much damage to kill. This phase is also a fantastic time to take advantage of Restoration Affinity by casting Rejuvination on the move, and even Wild Growth if you can stand still to cast it. Proper usage of Restoration Affinity can lead to impressive hps that is nothing to sneeze at.

Phase 2 is when you should cast your 2nd set of cooldowns, as soon as you've positioned for Ray of Frost. You can make great use of Wild Charge in this phase to group back up with your raid after dropping a Broadside on the Unexploded Ordnances. DoT the Ordnances to help bring them low for when you eventually want to kill them. Barkskin is very powerful here as you can sync it with both Siegebreaker casts. the 2nd Siegebreaker cast is especially scary for your entire raid, during this moment you should help out your healers if they need it and top someone who is low with Swiftmend and cast Wild Growth as well. Make sure once Jaina is at around 32% health you start pooling for p2 intermission, as this is when your damage starts to truly matter.

Phase 2 intermission is a dps race to destroy the Wall of Ice and also deal as much damage to Jaina as possible before being forced to break the wall and run to the Tide Elemental. Of course make sure to DoT both Jaina and the wall and focus whichever you're assigned to. Free Nathanos and pool Astral Power on the Tide Elemental for p3. 

Phase 3 is a very low movement phase in which a single mistake can kill the entire raid. Cast your final set of cooldowns once you're positioned properly on your raid and you've DoTed Jaina. Save Barkskin for when you get Broadsides or for Siegebreaker. Don't worry if you lose a few gcds of damage, just make sure you position yourself properly as to not mess up the Ray of Frost baits or Heart of Frost spreads.
