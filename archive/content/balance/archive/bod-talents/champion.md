<b>Notes</b>

This is a mostly stationary fight made up of 2 distinct phases, an add DPS phase and a Single target boss phase with priority add damage mixed in. We recommend taking talents that can push both boss damage and add damage. Starlord can be a strong choice if youâ€™re comfortable with the movement of this encounter as it allows for better priority damage.

<b>Notes</b>

Even though Twin Moons is slightly more damage over the course of the encounter, Stellar Flare is more damage on the boss, which is all that matters. Renewal is fine to take here, but realistically you're not going to wipe because of healing. The fight just has 0 movement.
