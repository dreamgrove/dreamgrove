## Heroic

<b>Notes</b>

A single target boss with strong add focus, it’s recommended to take full single target talents with the possible exceptions of Force of Nature and Fury of Elune which can be used to increase your DPS to the high priority adds that spawn throughout the fight if needed. Due to the immense damage dealt by Grong to both the raid and the tanks, we suggest using both Swiftmend and Wild Growth when needed and if the damage is too high, also take Renewal. Starlord is potentially quite useful for added priority damage, especially due to the low movement nature of the fight.

<b>Notes</b>

Grong is very similar on Mythic as compared to Heroic. The only real difference is that the boss summons 2 Apetagonizer Robots. This makes Twin Moon’s value significantly higher and better for add damage. Be looking to Swiftmend / Renewal / Barkskin / Engineering Belt / Bear Form the Tantrum casts as they are pretty lethal at times. The difference in Renewal and Wild Charge is pretty low as you can just move out of the fire before it happens, but you rarely need that much on demand healing from Swiftmend and Renewal.
