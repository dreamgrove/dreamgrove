<b>Notes</b>

Opulence starts out as a heavy movement single target fight, but upon defeating the guardians turns into a damage check with a large amount of add spawns. Heavy pooling is recommended, but no matter how much you prepare, you will be forced to eat downtime due to mechanics like Flames of Punishment.

The jewel you take depends heavily on your raid group, but the default choice should be the Opal of Unleashed Rage.

<b>Notes</b>

Opulence damage is heavily determined by which gem you get. Get Opal for maximum damage (Emerald if the boss dies quickly) and get Topaz if your guild requires you to. Don’t move immediately after the translocate as you will otherwise break your few seconds of immunity that you gain. Twin Moons and Fury of Elune are significantly better for damage overall and killing the adds. It’s recommended to always play Twin Moons, but there is merit for Stellar Flare if your raid does not need extra add damage. Fury of Elune is a free gcd for movement and grants very powerful burst that lines up with the add spawns in phase 2.
