<b>Notes</b>

A primarily single target oriented fight with priority add spawns, We advise you take Warrior of Elune to deal with the short bursts of movement that you can’t fully prepare for. Make sure to pool Astral Power for add spawns accordingly. Tiger Dash can be useful in dealing with short bursts of movement and also clearing the Freezing Tidepools in phase 2.

<b>Notes</b>

Stormwall Blockade is a fight that differs depending on which boat you are on, whether or not you are running the energized orb, and how you are doing the fight in general. There is merit to all the talents on the T30 row though. Tiger Dash is useful for running orbs in phase 2, and Wild Charge for dropping the Sea Storm debuff off of the ship. Pop Barkskin if you are going to get hit by the Voltaic Flash. Swiftmend is powerful for the high phase 1 damage taken. Barkskin if you are on Sister Katherine’s Boat and you are going to drop the Crackling Lightning, as it does a ton of damage and lines up with other mechanics generally.
