<b>Notes</b>

Jadefire Masters are a spread-cleave damage boss with spread add spawns. The Spirits of Xuen spawned by the boss are able to be stunned by Mighty Bash, so it should be the chosen tier 60 talent. Wild Charge is a must have to minimize downtime when dealing with the Magma Traps and also to mitigate the fall damage completely.

<b>Notes</b>

Jadefire Masters is a sustained 2 target fight. The only important difference on this encounter is that the boss summons 2 Xuen tigers instead of 1, potentially becoming much more dangerous. Mighty Bash can be used to stun the tigers so your raid group can deal with them cleanly. Additionally there is a Spirit of Niuzao that will chase you around in the maze which acts as a soft enrage if youâ€™re slow to destroy the barrier. Druid is one of the better classes at collecting the Force Orbs if your raid needs players to take that job. If soaking Magma Traps, be sure to use Wild Charge directly after being  knocked up to negate the mechanic, or Flap if Wild Charge is on cooldown.
