<b>Notes</b>

The Restless Cabal is a 2 target fight with heavy focus on single target priority damage with the added mechanic of a ranged DPS tanking one of the bosses full time. If you aren't tanking the caster boss, be sure to single target the correct boss based on which one you want to push into activating the relic, while keeping the other target DoTed. Make sure to switch to and burst down the Visage from Beyond add spawn, and also be in position to have range of any Eldritch Abomination so you can interrupt them if need be. 

If you're in charge of tanking the caster boss, Guardian Affinity is useful here as you will be taking as much damage as the tanks do, and consistently. Switch Hitter is a strong trait due to the high uptime avoidance granted through Frenzied Regeneration. This is especially helpful for the scariest parts of the fight, which are during the Tempest Caller raid AoE pulses, especially in conjunction with the Eldritch Abominations exploding. It is during these you should have your defensives being used (Barkskin and Frenzied Regeneration with Switch Hitter), along with healthstones and health potions, and even calling for externals if necessary to avoid being instantly killed. 

Position yourself alongside the edge of the room with your back to the edge and try to only move left or right, not backwards or forwards, otherwise you risk taking more damage or moving the boss and losing cleave. Cast Wild Charge and Dash to quickly move the boss to different relics when needed.
