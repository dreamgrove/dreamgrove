<b>Notes</b>
 
Uu'nat is a fight with constant spread cleave, but also with a focus on boss damage. 

P1: Position yourself on the edge of the room as to bait Oblivion Tears, and make sure to move away from the edge before Uu'nat casts Gift of N'zoth: Obscurity, as this will enclose the room more and more as phase 1 progresses. Use Wild Charge to quickly get out of the way of Maddening Eyes of N'Zoth and also to quickly cross the Piercing Gaze of N'Zoth beams, as you want to make sure you don't get hit by both within 4 seconds of eachother. Make sure to multi-DoT the Undying Guardians and only switch to them fully if you have to bring them low to finish them off with the Tempest Caller relic. 

P2: Use Wild Charge to escape the Unknowable Terror zone as to not get feared. Solar Beam is very powerful against Primordial Mindbenders if you can stack them up. Continue to multi-DoT the Undying Guardians and stand on the edge of the room for the Oblivion Tears.

P3: Be careful of cleaving your allies after Gift of N'Zoth: Lunacy is casted. It's useful to preemptively cast Wild Growth just before the cast goes off and then spam heal yourself during the hostile duration, as most of our abilities cleave. Stack with people who have Insatiable Torment so they don't die. Continue to multi-DoT the Undying Guardians and stand on the edge of the room for the Oblivion Tears. Save your last Incarn/CA for lust.
