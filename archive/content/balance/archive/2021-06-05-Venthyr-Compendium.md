This guide is not telling you to pick Venthyr or that Venthyr is always the superior pick. It is simply made to show everything about how to maximize your potential as a Venthyr Balance Druid if you do decide to play Venthyr.

All information in this guide was tested and verfied using simulations found here: https://balance-simc.github.io/Balance-SimC/

Everything in this guides assumes you are playing with Sinful Hysteria.

# [Single Target:](#single-target)

</div>

Due to no longer using Balance of All Things there is no longer as compelling of a reason to {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} at the beginning of an Eclipse and thus you can often save Astral Power for movement without any relevant dps loss. {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} Empowerment exists but it is a very weak effect.

On single target about 65% of your damage will be during CA/Inc+{{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}} meaning it is extremely important to be able to cast during that time and that the target will live for the entire duration of your cooldowns.

**Single target priority list OUTSIDE cooldowns:** 
- Keep up {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}, {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} and {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare" >}} and refresh within pandemic(30% of base duration).
- Enter the next Eclipse, preferring Solar Eclipse. With {{< spell 338668 "Primordial Arcanic Pulsar" >}} and {{< spell 364423 "Celestial Pillar" >}} you want to enter Lunar Eclipse before entering a {{< spell 338668 "Primordial Arcanic Pulsar" >}} window. 
- Cast {{< spell 211545 "Fury of Elune" >}} if it will be up again for your next usage in CA/Inc.
- Cast {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} when you would overcap Astral Power before entering the next Eclipse. This usually equates to spending 3 Starsurges at the start like you did with BoAT but can vary especially if you used moons or a foe. Don't spend if you need to move soon.
- Cast {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} in Solar Eclipse.
- Cast {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} in Lunar Eclipse.
- Cast dots if have nothing to cast while you are moving.

**Single target priority list BEFORE cooldowns:**
- Make sure to have 90+ Astral Power before using cooldowns. If possible try proccing your {{< spell 364423 "Celestial Pillar" >}} before your CDs so that you get more AP generation and the pillar scales with both eclipses.
- Make sure {{< spell 211545 "Fury of Elune" >}} will be up at the end.

**Single target priority list INSIDE cooldowns:**
Before the 3s extension buff:
- Use Berserking at the start of Frenzy without Bloodlust or at 8s of the initial buff remaining with Bloodlust.
- Use your trinket so that it will be for the rest of your cooldowns. Never ever use off gcd items/spells between casts, always use them during a gcd. (For exact timings see [Timings sections](#timings)).
- Use pot at 19s {{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}} remaining.
- Cast {{< spell 211545 "Fury of Elune" >}} if the initial {{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}} has 6 or less seconds remaining.
- Cast {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} to prevent capping Astral Power.
- Keep up {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}, {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} and {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare" >}}.
- Cast {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} to fill until 150% haste at which point you should fill with {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}}.

**During the 5s Ravenous Frenzy extension buff:**
- Cast {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} to spend all your Astral Power.
- Cast {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} to fill.

You can use the [Venthyr timings WeakAura](https://wago.io/KnnYdtGRN) to show the exact timings of abilities.

With {{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}} AND {{< spell 114107 "Soul of the Forest" >}} it is only a 1% dps loss to use Starfall on CD including during Frenzy so if there is any movement at all use Starfall when you happen to be doing single target with it talented. With {{< spell 102560 "Incarnation" >}} instead you should be using Starsurges during Frenzy as it is a much bigger loss (1% loss still applies for outside Frenzy). DO NOT just use {{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}} for a pure single target fight as it is still a ~4% dps loss doing this compared to {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare " >}}.

2+ target priority OUTSIDE cooldowns:

**Any situation:**
- Keep up {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} as long as your targets will live for another ~10 seconds (the amount of time is reduced per target hit).
- Keep up {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} at all times or use on cooldown with{{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}} .
- Enter Solar Eclipse if you can't enter Lunar Eclipse.
- Before Lunar Eclipse cast {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} if:
   - All targets can be hit by {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}}.
   - There are 5 or less targets (10 or less with {{< spell 281847 "Twin Moons" >}}).
   - All targets will live through the entire Lunar Eclipse.
   - You will not lose {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} uptime.
- Enter Lunar Eclipse if you can.

**During Solar Eclipse:**
  - Use {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} to prevent overcapping.
  - Keep up {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} on up to 10 targets (20 with {{< spell 281847 "Twin Moons" >}}) if they will live through the next Eclipse and you won't lose {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} uptime.
  - {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} when 5 targets can be hit by it, increased by 1 target for every 20% mastery you have.
  - Cast {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}}.

**During Lunar Eclipse:**
  - Use {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} to prevent overcapping AsP until 6 targets at which point you should overcap.
  - Refresh {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} if you are at 4 (8 with {{< spell 281847 "Twin Moons" >}}) targets or below if the targets will live through the next Eclipse.
  - Cast {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}}.

**BEFORE cooldowns:**

- If the pack will last more than 35s put {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} on up to 8 targets (16 with {{< spell 281847 "Twin Moons" >}}). This happens very rarely but is a gain in case it happens.
- Refresh {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} so you only have to refresh it once during Cooldowns.

**DURING {{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}}:**
- Refresh {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} during pandemic(30% of base duration).
- Keep {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} up at all times or on cooldown with {{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}}.
- Refresh {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} on up to 6 (12 with {{< spell 281847 "Twin Moons" >}}) targets when they will live for another ~20 seconds.
- Use the [FrenyzFiller Weakaura](https://wago.io/mYVIsyQN8) to see which filler should be cast. The recommendations this WeakAura gives is not correct when your targets will die before your cooldowns end or the targets are spread.
- If the filler is {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} or up to 5 targets use {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} to prevent overcapping.

# [Timings:](#timings)
This is a list of timings of ability/item usages during Ravenous Frenzy. All of these are included in the [Venthyr timings WeakAura](https://wago.io/KnnYdtGRN). The seconds listed here are how much time the Ravenous Frenzy buff without the extension should have left.

{{< spell 194223 "Celestial Alignment" >}} (when using SotF in Dungeons):   
At 10s + your {{< spell 340706 "Precise Alignment" >}} time value remaining. For example with a heroic {{< spell 340706 "Precise Alignment" >}} which adds 8.5s at 18.5s. 
  
{{< item 180117 "Empyreal Ordnance" >}}: 
This heavily depends on distance to target. At 30m it would be 3s before using Ravenous Frenzy.

The following are minor things you can do to gain a small amount of extra damage once you are comfortable with the rotation:
- Dotting outside Eclipse without losing dot uptime on single target is a ~0.4% gain when not using Solstice.
- At 150%+ haste using {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} is minorly better than{{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} on single target. This will only happen with Power Infusion or very high base haste.
- When {{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}} has less than your current filler's cast time left you should already start dumping Astral Power to get another 1-2 stacks. This is about a 0.6% gain.
- With {{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}} it is only a very minor loss (1-2%) to {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} during {{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}} as long as you enter Sinful Hysteria with 90+ AsP.
- Without Incarnation and a low enough {{< spell 340706 "Precise Alignment" >}} it is a minor gain to use {{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}}  before Celestial Alignment so that CA will be up throughout Frenzy+Hysteria. The exact timing depends on your {{< spell 340706 "Precise Alignment" >}} rank but it should be no more than 2 globals after the Frenzy cast.
- If the fight time allows it wait for Euphoria/Fatal Flaw(Nadija Soulbinds) before using cooldowns. This is relevant for 5-6 min kill times.
- If the fight allows it wait for pot to be up again. This is relevant for 6min fights.

# [Gear:](#gear)
  
</div>

**Simming:**

Once everything is on live you will be able to sim as normal and that will, as always, give you the best results. It is to note that for Venthyr sims adjusting the fight duration can have a relevant impact on how strong some items maybe so it can be beneficial to adjust the sim duration to fight the fight you are simming for. Keep in mind that there will be a 20% fight length variance in sims meaning that a 5min sim is actually a 4-6min sim.

**Trinkets:**

Generally you will want an on-use trinket and the strongest passive trinket you can find. The strongest on-use trinkets are {{< item 179350 "Inscrutable Quantum Device" >}}, {{< item 180117 "Empyreal Ordnance" >}} (yes, without double on-use) and {{< item 184842 "Instructor's Divine Bell" >}} (yes, it's still broken even at low ilvl). IQD and Bell can be combined for a minor dps increase in the sub 0.5% area, although if that is better with your ilvl trinket you will have to sim. The raid on-use trinkets are all bad because we are a 3min class.

As a passive trinket you have a plethora of options. For single target your best options are the new trinkets {{< item 186423 "Titanic Ocular Gland" >}} (2nd boss raid), {{< item 186421 "Forbidden Necromantic Tome" >}} (last boss raid), {{< item 186422 "Tome of Monstrous Constructions" >}} (1st boss raid), {{< item 178769 "Infinitely Divisble Ooze" >}}, {{< item 178708 "Unbound Changeling" >}}, {{< item 187447 "Soul Cage Fragment" >}} (World Boss) and a bunch of others. For AoE/M+ the damage proc trinkets fall off meaning you won't want the Tome or Oooze but the other trinkets stay as good. As always just sim what trinkets are best from the ones you have.

**Ideal stats:**

Ideal stats are something that are not realistic to achieve and should thus not be a goal of any kind, this section is purely for interest. Independent of that with Venthyr Balance Druid mastery and haste are far, far more valuable than crit and vers as your sims will show. In fact when you could choose any kind of stats you wouldn't want any crit or vers but again this is not realistic.
