# [1. News:](#news)

</div>



## Season 4 Balance Druid and You:

**What items should I look out for?**
Biggest item is always a weapon, the best one being Antumbra. After that you should look for good trinkets which are: 
{{< item 186428 "Shadowed Orb of Torment" >}}, {{< item 184028 "Cabalist's Hymnal" >}}, {{< item 137541 "Moonlit Prism" >}}, {{< item 188271 "The First Sigil" >}}, {{< item 186423 "Titanic Ocular Gland" >}}, {{< item 110001 "Tovra's Lightning Repository" >}}, {{< item 185818 "So'leah's Secret Technique" >}} and {{< item 142165 "Deteriorated Construct Core" >}} for AoE/M+.
On other pieces you always want the highest ilvl items which will drop from the last bosses in each raid.
In general sim yourself since whatever you loot early on will likely be an upgrade.

**Should I farm any dungeon?**
As is the case in every new season start, farming dungeons just for ilvl can give a large dps boost before you get better mythic items.
Grimrail Depot and Gambit are good options until you have a passive trinket.
Run Droptimizer to see what dungeon currently has the best gear for you.

**What should I spend my Coins on?**
1. Antumbra.
2. This depends on how quick bosses die. If they consistently die sub 3 minutes Sigil, otherwise Shadowed Orb of Torment.
3. Sim what slot is your biggest upgrade.
Of course if you have anything comparable already sim what your biggest upgrade is.

**What slot will Unity and Pulsar go on?**
Due to legendaries not getting higher ilvl Unity will end up on Wrists and Pulsar will stay on Ring with max ilvl gear. Before that just stick with what you have.

**What covenant are we playing?**
Venthyr will do more damage on most bosses due to the temporary damage boost and likely short kill times.
There are exceptions where Venthyr won't work well due to timings like Denathrius. 

**IQD dead?**
Yes, once you get a replacement and outside sub 1 minute fights.

**Are Mechagon rings worth it?**
No, they are at best a 0.5% upgrade over other options for NF and never for Venthyr.

**What stat are we getting from shrouded affix?**
Haste.

**Is Scars good now?**
Equal at best, so no because of the drawbacks.

<div id="aoe">
 
## [What is my AoE priority?](#aoe)

</div>

**Venthyr specific notes will be marked with (V) at the start of a point and Night Fae specific ones will be marked with (NF)**

**AoE starting at 2 targets:**

**Any situation:**

- Keep up {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} as long as your targets will live for another ~10 seconds (the amount of time is reduced per target hit).

- Keep up {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} at all times or use on cooldown with {{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}} .

**Outside any Eclipse:**

- Refresh {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} outside of Eclipse if and only if ALL of the following are true:
    - The next eclipse you will enter is Lunar Eclipse
    - All targets can be hit by {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}}
    - There are 5 or less targets (10 or less with {{< spell 281847 "Twin Moons" >}}).
    - All targets will live through the entire Lunar Eclipse
    - You will not lose {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} uptime.

- Enter the next Eclipse if no Eclipse is active, preferring Lunar Eclipse.

**Lunar Eclipse and both Eclipses (CA/Inc):**

- Use {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} to stop yourself from overcapping AsP. *Without* Pulsar you should overcap when Starfire will hit 6 or more targets. *With* Pulsar you should only overcap when Starfire will hit 6 or more targets and CA/Inc or Lunar Eclipse will last throughout the rest of the fight or big pull. 

- Refresh {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} if you are at 4 (8 with {{< spell 281847 "Twin Moons" >}}) targets or below if the targets will live through the next Eclipse.

- Cast Wrath during CA/Inc if you are not using {{< spell 114107 "Soul of the Forest" >}}, Starfire will only hit 2 targets and the fight will last at least ~60s longer.

- Cast {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}}.

**Solar Eclipse:**

- Use Starsurge to stop yourself from overcapping AsP.

- Keep up {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} on up to 10 targets (20 with {{< spell 281847 "Twin Moons" >}}) if they will live through the next Eclipse and you won't lose {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} uptime.

- Starfire when 5 targets can be hit by it, increased by 1 target for every 20% mastery you have.

- Cast {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}}.

**BEFORE cooldowns:**

- If the pack will last more than 35s put {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} on up to 8 targets (16 with {{< spell 281847 "Twin Moons" >}}). This happens very rarely but is a gain in case it happens.
- (V) Refresh {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} so you only have to refresh it once during Cooldowns.

**(V) DURING {{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}}:**
- Refresh {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} during pandemic (30% of base duration).
- Keep {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} up at all times or on cooldown with {{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}}. Try to time the last {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} with Drift so that it will be up during the last 8s of your cooldowns. Do not lose more than 1-2s of {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} uptime to achieve this.
- Refresh {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} on up to 6 (12 with {{< spell 281847 "Twin Moons" >}}) targets when they will live for another ~20 seconds.
- https://wago.io/mYVIsyQN8 for filler. The recommendation this WeakAura gives is not correct when your targets will die before Ravenous Frenzy ends or the targets are spread.
- If the filler is {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}}, you are using Pulsar or up to 5 targets use {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} to prevent overcapping.

**Notes:**

- This should be used as a priority, going from top to bottom.


<div id="st">

## [What is my Single Target rotation?](#st)

</div>

**Venthyr specific notes will be marked with (V) at the start of a point and Night Fae specific ones will be marked with (NF)**


**Single target priority list OUTSIDE cooldowns:**
- Keep up {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}, {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} and {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare" >}} and refresh within pandemic (30% of base duration).
- Enter Solar Eclipse when either not using {{< spell 338668 "Primordial Arcanic Pulsar" >}} and {{< spell 364423 "Celestial Pillar" >}} (T28 2pc) or you have less than 210 stacks in your Pulsar buff and Convoke will not come off cooldown in the next 15s. Enter Lunar Eclipse otherwise.
- Cast {{< spell 211545 "Fury of Elune" >}} if it will be up again during your next usage in CA/Inc and Pulsar has less than 240 stacks.
- Cast {{< spell 274281 "Moons" >}} in any Eclipse if you would overcap charges. Save any other Moons for CA/Inc and when using Pulsar don’t use charges when above 210 Pulsar stacks.
- Cast {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} when you would overcap Astral Power before entering the next Eclipse. Your general goal is to start each new Eclipse with 90+ Astral Power but whenever there is movement coming up, you should prefer pooling Astral Power based on that. Starsurge empowerments only add a miniscule amount of damage.
- Cast {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} in Solar Eclipse.
- Cast {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} in Lunar Eclipse.
- Cast dots if you have nothing to cast while you are moving.

**Single target priority list BEFORE cooldowns:**
- Make sure to have 90+ Astral Power before using cooldowns. The only exception is when Bloodlust would run out before Inc expires, at which point you Inc+Frenzy sooner. This happens with Bloodlust on pull.
- Make sure all relevant Cooldowns will be ready when you need them during CDs. This includes Fury of Elune, Moons, Berserking, Trinkets etc.
- With T28 2pc enter Lunar Eclipse before using CDs so that you gain the extra Astral Power during CDs.
- Refresh your dots when they have less than ~10s remaining.

**(Non-V) Single target priority list INSIDE cooldowns:**
- Use all trinkets, pots and Berserking with your CD cast.
- Cast Starsurge whenever you aren’t saving it for movement.
- (NF) Cast Convoke once you hit 40 Astral Power or less. 30 when you don’t have Celestial Spirits yet.
- Cast Fury of Elune and Moons as soon as you can without overcapping.
- Refresh all dots within pandemic unless this would stop you from spending all Astral Power before CDs end.
- Cast Wrath when you have less than 110% haste.
- Cast Starfire when you have more than 110% haste.

**(V) Single target priority list INSIDE cooldowns:**
Before the 3s extension buff:
- Use {{< spell 26297 "Berserking" >}} at the start of Frenzy unless you are getting PI. If you get PI use at at 9s of the initial buff remaining with Bloodlust.
- Use your trinket so that it will be for the rest of your cooldowns. Never ever use off gcd items/spells between casts, always use them during a gcd. Use the Venthyr timings to see the exact timings.
- Use pot at 19s {{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}} remaining.
- Cast {{< spell 211545 "Fury of Elune" >}} if the initial {{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}} has 5s remaining.
- Cast {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} to prevent capping Astral Power or when you wouldn’t be able to dump all Astral Power before the entire Ravenous Frenzy ends.
- Keep up {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}, {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}} and {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare" >}}.
- Cast {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} to fill until 150% haste at which point you should fill with {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}}.

**(V) During the 3s Sinful Hysteria window:**
- Cast {{< spell 78674 "Starsurge" >}} to spend all your Astral Power.
- Cast {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} to fill.

**(NF)Convoke the Spirits and Pulsar usage:**
- Always cast Convoke inside {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}} / {{< spell 102560 "INC" >}}. Delay or proc Pulsar sooner depending on when Convoke is coming up. This does not mean you should overcap Astral Power.
- If possible try lining up a pooled up Pulsar with {{< spell 102560 "INC" >}}. It is important to note that if you are already in Inc, proccing pulsar will extend the duration of Inc, but using Inc inside a pulsar window will not extend it. This is only relevant when the fight allows you to freely choose further Inc timings.

**Notes:**
- While using {{< spell 338668 "Primordial Arcanic Pulsar" >}} make sure to activate the proc by using a Starfall and not a Starsurge, as the Starfall will use the Incarnation bonus damage and the Starsurge will not. This is the case even without Stellar Drift when using the T28 4pc.

- (V) With {{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}} AND {{< spell 114107 "Soul of the Forest" >}} it is only a 1% dps loss to use Starfall on CD including during Frenzy so if there is any movement at all use Starfall when you happen to be attacking a single target with it talented. With {{< spell 102560 "Incarnation" >}} talented you should avoid using Starfalls during Frenzy as it is a much bigger loss but with {{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}} Starfall should still be used to avoid downtime. 


<div id="filler">
 
## [What is my filler priority inside CA/Inc?](#filler)

</div>

1 Target:
- Starfire if at or above 110% haste for Night Fae and 150% for Venthyr (These values can be reached during Bloodlust and any other big haste buff. A WeakAura tracking your current haste value might come in handy.)
- {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} if below 110% haste for Night Fae and 150% for Venthyr

2 Targets and above:
- {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}}


<div id="owlkin-frenzy">

## [How do I use instant Starfire procs from Owlkin Frenzy?](#owlkin-frenzy)

</div>

When Lunar Eclipse is active use {{< spell 157228 "Owlkin Frenzy" >}} procs as soon as possible. When ONLY Solar Eclipse is active, use it when fighting 3+ targets or when you need to move. Otherwise let it expire.


<div id="snapshot">

## [Do our dots snapshot?](#snapshot)

</div>

No, all of our periodic damage (like {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}, {{< spell 93402 "Sunfire" >}}, {{< spell 202347 "Stellar Flare " >}}) does NOT snapshot, everything is dynamic. That means any dots gain/lose the mastery bonus upon entering/leaving the Eclipse that buffs them and whenever any other stat/damage increases are applied/expire.


<div id="setup">

# [3. Flexible Setups:](#setup)

</div>


<div id="stats">
 
## [What is Balance Druids stat priority?](#stats)

</div>

Sim yourself using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). Do not follow any stat priorities.


<div id="trinkets">

## [What Trinkets should I use?](#trinkets)

</div>

**DISCLAIMER: All of the trinkets in the following are examples. Your personal best trinkets depend on more factors such as ilvl meaning the best option is always to sim using either Top Gear, Droptimizer or Gear Compare.**


**Usable trinkets:**

- Slot 1 (Equip): {{< item 186423 "Titanic Ocular Gland" >}}, {{< item 184028 "Cabalist's Hymnal" >}}, {{< item 185818 "So'leah's Secret Technique" >}} and others.
- Slot 2 (On-use): {{< item 137541 "Moonlit Prism" >}}, {{< item 186428 "Shadowed Orb of Torment" >}} and others.


**Notable trinkets:**

{{< item 137541 "Moonlit Prism" >}} Tied as best on use trinket with {{< item 186428 "Shadowed Orb of Torment" >}} depending on setup

<br>{{< item 186428 "Shadowed Orb of Torment" >}} Tied as best on use trinket with {{< item 137541 "Moonlit Prism" >}} depending on setup

<br>{{< item 188271 "The First Sigil" >}} Good on use alternative to Orb/MLP, if the fight duration is lower than 3minutes. 

<br>{{< item 188270 "Elegy of the Eternals" >}} Mediocre to good equip trinket if you do not have better alternatives. 

<br>{{< item 185818 "So'leah's Secret Technique" >}} Good farmable trinket for early season.

<br>{{< item 184028 "Cabalist's Hymnal" >}} Potentially the best equip trinket depending on how many people you have in your group.

<br>{{< item 186423 "Titanic Ocular Gland" >}} Good passive option.

<br>{{< item 186422 "Tome of Monstrous Constructions" >}} Good passive trinket for pure ST. (pretty bad overall trinket)

<br>{{< item 188253 "Scars of do NOT Play This" >}} The best trinket if you want to die on every fight.

<br>{{< item 110001 "Tovra's Lightning Repository" >}} Good farmable trinket for early season.

<br>{{< item 142165 "Deteriorated Construct Core" >}} The best heavy aoe passive trinket. (use this in m+)





<div id="talents">
 
## [What Talents should I run?](#talents)

</div>

**Default single target setup (pure single target raid bosses):**
{{< talents spec="balance" src="live" recommend="311,123,133,223,123,113,233" >}}
{{< spell 211545 "Fury of Elune" >}} and {{< spell 102560 "Incarnation" >}} should be used as Venthyr. {{< spell 274281 "New Moon" >}} should be picked for any other covenant while keeping in mind that the difference on single target is always very low.

**Default AoE setup (M+ and heavy AoE bosses):**
{{< talents spec="balance" src="live" recommend="332,113,133,223,311,331,231" >}}
Note that {{< spell 248280 "Force of Nature" >}} can and should be used in M+ for any key level where the tank could die even though they are a minor dps loss.
WoE performs better on 4+ sustained targets or heavy AoE burst.
The choice between {{< spell 281847 "Twin Moons" >}} and Drift depends on how long targets live and how much value the movement has. A general rule of thumb is pick {{< spell 281847 "Twin Moons" >}} if there are consistently 4+ targets that live 20+ seconds.

**Mixed target count or mostly spread AoE (Council type bosses or bosses with add waves):**
{{< talents spec="balance" src="live" recommend="321,113,133,223,213,231,232" >}}
{{< spell 114107 "Soul of the forest" >}} should only be picked for bosses with extended stacked AoE.


<div id="t50">
 
## [T50 row choices and playstyle](#t50)

<div>
 

**The currently most viable playstyles are:**

   - Venthyr Pulsar (+Unity)
   - NF Pulsar (+Unity)
   - Kyrian Pulsar (+Unity)

**Venthyr Pulsar:**

- {{< spell 343647 "Solstice" >}} is playable in spread aoe but requires 3+ targets of permanent uptime which can be very very hard to find. 

- {{< spell 202770 "FoE" >}} is incredibly strong and beats out the other talents in 99% of the situations on both ST and stacked AoE. You will want to use FoE whenever you have 5 sec left on Ravenous Frenzy inside Incarnation, and on CD inside any eclipse whenever outside of it.

- {{< spell 274281 "Moons" >}} should never get picked with this build as they are inferior to FoE in every scenario.

**NF + Kyrian Pulsar:**

- {{< spell 343647 "Solstice" >}} is a better choice for this build when compared to Venthyr because of the fact that FoE is not as strong, meaning that you will have more opportunities to pick this talent depending on the raid fight. Currently there is no situation where it is better but it can still be picked without a major loss.

- {{< spell 202770 "FoE" >}} is again very strong for any encounters where you can benefit from the cleave and should be the default pick for such situations.

- {{< spell 274281 "Moons" >}} should be picked over FoE whenever single target is more important. Save moons for CA/Inc without overcapping and if not inside CA/Inc use them as to not overcap on charges.


<div id="conduits">
 
## [What Conduits should I pick?](#conduits)

</div>

**Potency:**
- {{< spell 341383 "Endless Thrist" >}}: 100% of the time this should be your first go to potency slot as Venthyr.
- {{< spell 341446 "Conflux of the Elements" >}}: 100% of the time this should be your first go to potency slot as Night Fae.
- {{< spell 341378 "Deep Allegiance" >}}: 90% of the time this should be your first go to potency slot as Kyrian as it enables 45sec bond.
- {{< spell 340708 "Fury of the Skies" >}}: Default go to as a secondary slot.
- {{< spell 340706 "Precise Alignment" >}}: In general this is the 3rd strongest conduit that can sometimes be replaced if more concentrated burst is important.
- {{< spell 340719 "Umbral Intensity" >}}: Situational usage for higher burst AoE.
- {{< spell 340720 "Stellar Inspiration" >}}: Situational usage for sustained AoE.

Notes:
  - This should be used as a priority list, going from top to bottom.
 

**Endurance:**
- {{< spell 340553 "Well-Honed Instincts" >}}: A must have. One of the most overtuned endurance conduits in the game, defensive-wise.
- {{< spell 340540 "Ursine Vigor" >}}: Really good if you will ever go into bear form to soak an ability. Especially good on progression and if you will ever press Heart of the Wild while being talented into Guardian Affinity.
- {{< spell 340529 "Tough as Bark" >}}: Good if you press Barkskin a lot or the fight timers allow a shorter Barkskin to line up better with certain abilities. Should only be used if you know you can get value from the lower CD.
- {{< spell 357888 "Condensed Anima Sphere" >}}: Minor passive healing that can be useful on rot damage fights. Don’t use it for any fights where you usually die to burst damage.
- {{< spell 340543 "Innate Resolve" >}}: Mediocre value since it will only have value when {{< spell 340553 "Well-Honed Instincts" >}} procs or you are already actively healing yourself. In both cases you are very likely already safe.
- {{< spell 340605 "Layered Mane" >}}: Unlike Well-Honed Instincs this is a Guardian conduit that actually only Guardian wants.

Notes: Default Instincts and fill in the rest as needed.

**Finesse:**
- {{< spell 341450 "Front of the Pack" >}}: The best default pick as roar is very useful in many raid encounters and to get around dungeons quicker.
- {{< spell 341280 "Born Anew" >}}: Useful pick to get someone up again without them losing as much damage from the lost food buff. Can no longer be used before a pull as the food buff will reset to 20 main stat on raid combat start. At least one druid should have this during progression fights.
- {{< spell 341451 "Born of the Wilds" >}}: Good if you have to offheal a lot through Heart of the Wild and the CD reduction would allow better usage.
- {{< spell 340545 "Tireless Pursuit" >}}: Can be very strong if you often find yourself using Cat Form/Travel Form to dodge mechanics/get around.


<div id="soulbinds">
 
## [What Soulbinds should I pick?](#soulbinds)

</div>

**Night Fae:**
- Nearly all situations: [Niya](https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/night-fae/niya/druid/AwaW6pYBBTXKChMFNcYKFTLiCiUy5AoiFTJJCjV2AAo)
- For sustained AoE when you can stand in the small Blossom field: [Dreamweaver](https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/night-fae/dreamweaver/druid/AwaZZr4BJTXKChMFNcYKFTLiCiUy5AoiBTJJCiV2AAo)

**Venthyr:**
- Always use [Theotar](https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/venthyr/theotar-the-mad-duke/druid/AwaW5b4CBTXKChUyQQoTBTWHChUy5AolMuIKIwV2AAoVMkkKNTI8Cg). You can choose between Token of Appreciation (with Precise Alignment, Fury of the Skies is played by default as 2nd potency slot) and Wasteland Propriety. Wasteland Propriety is on average 350dps from the allies that recieve your 3% versatility buff. Sim both of them and decide for yourself. On average Token of Appreciation gives you around 350hps for your allies. If you only want to think about dps, Wasteland Propriety will be better in most casses for raid dps and Token will be better for personal dps (obviously this depends heavily on your character's gear so sim yourself).
 
**Kyrian:**
- By default [Mikanikos](https://www.wowhead.com/soulbind-calc/kyrian/forgelite-prime-mikanikos/druid/AwaW5ZYBBTXKChMFNYIKFTLiCiUy5AoiFTJJCjUyPAo).

## [What Legendaries should I craft?](#legendaries)

</div>

**Single Legendary:**
 
 
**Night Fae:**

{{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}} with Mastery + Haste

**Venthyr:**

{{< spell 355315 "Sinful Hysteria" >}} with Mastery + Haste with no Tier Set
<br>{{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}} with Mastery + Haste with Tier Set (2 or above)

**Kyrian:**

{{< spell 354115 "Kindred Affinity" >}} with Mastery + Haste
 
**Double Legendary:**  
 
 {{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}} + {{< item 190465 "Unity" >}} with Mastery + Haste.
 
<div id="legendaries-slot">

## [What slot do I craft legendaries in?](#legendaries-slot)

</div>

**{{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}} slot:**

Craft this legendary on Ring to not use up a Tier slot.

**{{< item 190465 "Unity" >}} slot:**
 
There are three options when it comes to crafting this legendary. Those being budget, endgame and progression.
  + Budget: Free Waist from Campaign
<br>With the budget version you can technically only get the free version from week 5 of the campaign, although this is much weaker when you can instead craft a max ilvl version on a slot of your choice.
  + Endgame: Legs Haste + Mastery
<br>This is the conservative option and what will ultimately be the "BiS" option at the very end of the tier if you are mythic raiding and have all the mythic raid pieces available to you. This is because Legs and Head are not available at higher ilvl and the raid legs have bad stats on them. In some cases this can change if you get good legs from your vault.
  + Progression: Top Gear Haste + Mastery
<br>During progression it will be optimal to have the legendary in a slot that gains you the most dps with your current gear and any gear you are very likely to get soon. If Gold is no problem it is likely you will have to craft multiple Unity legendaries. There are some things to keep in mind though: Having Mastery+Haste Missives on it is a given as you will be able to flex your other gear pieces more depending on what you get dropped. Your other gear in general has a big influence on what slot you want to craft it on. Week 5 (when Unity unlocks) you will have some slots on low ilvl, which you will most likely want to replace. A good rule of thumb is to get as much int as possible (ilvl) while trying to replace the bad stats. TL;DR: Use Top Gear on Raidbots.
 
<div id="covenant">

## [What Covenant should I pick?](#covenant)

</div>

**Venthyr:**

In 9.2 Venthyr will still be the best covenant if the NF utility or damage profile is not needed. It is worth noting that the difference between NF and Venthyr is now much closer due to the Hysteria nerf and the new tier set.


**Night Fae:**
 
With the new tier set, Night Fae will be much closer to Venthyr ST dps wise and should be picked depending on encounter.


**Kyrian:**

With the nerf to the Kyrian legendary, this covenant is now on par with venthyr on raid dps. Because of how clunky the actual bond is and how fast you can lose value on it you should always try to use the other two viable covenants.

**Necrolord:**

Still not competitive, might be viable in 10.0.

</div>


<div id="nightfae">

## [Night Fae:](#nightfae)

</div>

**Should I delay Convoke for it to line up with Inc/CA?**

*Before having the Unity legendary:*
With Pulsar you should use {{< spell 323764 "Convoke" >}} on cooldown with a Pulsar proc UNLESS you can delay a Convoke without losing a Convoke cast. This will for example happen in 3:30 minute fights where you would cast Convoke+CA on pull and then CA+Convoke at 3 minutes. The same goes for Inc/CA where you would only delay it if you wouldn't lose a cast. In a similar example on a 5 minute fight you would CA+Convoke on pull, Convoke with the first Pulsar proc after 2 minutes and CA+Convoke whenever Convoke is ready again. On a 7 minute fight you would CA+Convoke on pull, Convoke with the first Pulsar proc after 2 minutes, CA at 3 minutes, Convoke with the first Pulsar proc after 4 minutes and then CA+Convoke whenever the 4th Convoke becomes ready.

For M+ the same logic applies although the exact timings can vary more since not every pack lasts long enough for a CA.

*With the Unity legendary:*
Always use Convoke inside CA/Inc and try to slightly delay/push forward your Pulsar windows to line up with Convoke.
 
**What is the chance of getting Full Moon during Convoke?**
 
The chance to get a Full Moon during Convoke the Spirits is based on a "Stacked Deck" system with a deck of 5 cards. What this means every time we enter a new combat we get a deck of 5 cards and one of them is Full Moon. Every time we use Convoke, one card is drawn so the first cast always has a 20% chance of casting Full Moon. If the first cast didn't proc a Full Moon, the second cast will have a 1/4=25% chance to proc one and so on. After the whole deck has been drawn or you leave combat, a new deck of 5 cards is created. In a normal raid encounter this mechanic means that you will never get more than 1 Full Moon unless you died as you'd have to cast 6 Convokes to even have a chance to get another Full Moon.

**How does the covenant legendary affect Convoke?**

Currently it reduces the spells cast by 1/4 and casts 3.3 Wraths, 2.8 Starsurges, 1 Starfall and 0.5 Full Moons on average when every target has Moonfire and Starfall is not up. This is about half the Wrath and Starsurge casts than without the legendary. Additionally the legendary reduces the amount of cards in the deck for Full Moon from 5 to 2.

<div id="minmax">

### [MinMax:](#minmax)
 
</div>

The following are super minor things you can do to gain a small amount of extra damage once you are comfortable with the rotation:
- Dotting outside Eclipse without losing dot uptime on single target is a ~0.4% gain when not using Solstice.
- At 150%+ haste using {{< spell 194153 "Starfire" >}} is minorly better than {{< spell 190984 "Wrath" >}} on single target. This will only happen with Power Infusion or very high base haste.
- When {{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}} has less than your current fillers cast time left you should already start dumping Astral Power to get another 1-2 stacks. This is about a 0.6% gain.
- With {{< spell 202354 "Stellar Drift" >}} it is only a very minor loss (1-2%) to {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} during {{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}} as long as you enter Sinful Hysteria with 90+ AsP.
- Without Incarnation and a low enough {{< spell 340706 "Precise Alignment" >}} it is a minor gain to use {{< spell 323546 "Ravenous Frenzy" >}}  before Celestial Alignment so that CA will be up throughout Frenzy+Hysteria. The exact timing depends on your {{< spell 340706 "Precise Alignment" >}} rank but it should be no more than 2 globals after the Frenzy cast.
- If the fight time allows it wait for Euphoria/Fatal Flaw(Nadija Soulbinds) before using cooldowns. This is relevant for 5-6 min kill times.
- If the fight allows it, wait for pot to be up again. This is relevant for 6min fights.

<div id="gear">

### [Gear:](#gear)
 
</div>

**Simming:**

Once everything is on live you will be able to sim as normal and that will, as always, give you the best results. It is to note that for Venthyr sims adjusting the fight duration can have a relevant impact on how strong some items may be so it can be beneficial to adjust the sim duration to fight the fight you are simming for. Keep in mind that there will be a 20% fight length variance in sims meaning that a 5min sim is actually a 4-6min sim.

**Trinkets:**

Generally you will want an on-use trinket and the strongest passive trinket you can find. The strongest on-use trinket is {{< item 179350 "Inscrutable Quantum Device" >}}. If you have {{< spell 355315 "Sinful Hysteria" >}} equipped, {{< item 179350 "Inscrutable Quantum Device" >}} and {{< item 188271 "The First Sigil" >}} are also a good option. If playing with this combination of trinkets use {{< item 179350 "IQD" >}} together with Inc and RF, then use {{< item 188271 "Sigil" >}} as soon as it is available.

**Ideal stats:**

Ideal stats are something that are not realistic to achieve and should thus not be a goal of any kind, this section is purely for interest. Independent of that with Venthyr Balance Druid mastery and haste are far, far more valuable than crit and vers as your sims will show. In fact when you could choose any kind of stats you wouldn't want any crit or vers but again this is not realistic.

- How does Kindred Spirits (Kyrian covenant ability) work?

When you use {{< spell 326434 "Kindred Spirits" >}} both people get an empty pool that lasts 20 seconds and 15% of your damage, healing and damage taken empties the pool to increase/absorb each. Each person also gets a buff that lasts 10 seconds and during that time 20% of your damage fills up the pool of the other person.



- Who do I bond Kindred Spirits with and when do I use it?

With {{< spell 354115 "Kindred Affinity" >}} you prefer to bond with a Night Fae because of the haste buff being multiplicative unlike the other buffs.
A sheet for Kindred Affinity with tier sets and 2 legendaries and more information can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1baQypWt2RjCYvtRQ7T5fPXqK18FeZON9XtR-LRvSGXo/edit?usp=sharing).

## [Useful CA + Trinket macro:](#swifty-macro)

</div>


```
#showtooltip
/stopmacro [noform:4]
/cast Celestial Alignment
/cleartarget
/use 13
/targetlasttarget
/use Potion of Spectral Intellect
```

**Explanation:**

- "#showtooltip" makes the tooltip of {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}} (or Inc) show upon hovering over the macro.
- "/stopmacro [noform:4]" prevents the macro from being casted if you are NOT in Moonkin Form.
- "/cast Celestial Alignment" casts {{< spell 194223 "CA" >}}.
- "/cleartarget" clears your current target. This is useful whenever using the "Inscrutable Quantum Device" trinket and makes it so that the trinket does not use its execute part. Do not use this with a targeted trinket.
- "/use 13" uses the trinket in the 13/upper slot. You can use 14 if your on-use trinket is in the bottom slot.
- "/targetlasttarget retargets your last target after being cleared by the "cleartarget".
- "/use Potion of Spectral Intellect" uses your potion. If your potion is not assigned to any specific point you can put it here.

You can and should remove/add other commands to this macro depending on situation. For example the potion line, or the "stopmacro [noform:4]" line.

  
<div id="Set-TLDR">
 
## [Tier Set TLDR](#Set-TLDR)

</div>
  
**How to optimise {{< spell 364423 "Celestial Pillar" >}} and {{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}} usage:**

- Always proc Pulsar with Starfall if you are not in Incarnation already and have Stellar Drift talented or 4 Set active.
- Always try to get the {{< spell 364423 "Celestial Pillar" >}} effect before proccing {{< spell 338668 "Pulsar" >}}. This means that you should if possible go into Lunar Eclipse before a Pulsar window.
- Have as much AsP as possible before going into a Pulsar window without overcapping.
- If you have below 210 AsP transition into a Solar Eclipse.
- Dump all AsP inside Incarnation windows.

  
  
<div id="iqd">
 
## [How does Inscrutable Quantum Device work?](#iqd)

</div>

When this trinket is used, it triggers the effect with the first condition that applies from the following list:

- Remove CC from self: Always triggers if you are under a hard CC mechanic, does not trigger if the CC mechanic does not prevent the player from acting (e.g., it won't trigger while rooted).

- Heal spell: Triggers on self or a nearby target with less than 30% health remaining.

- Execute damage: Deals damage to the target if it is an enemy with less than 20% health remaining. (You can prevent this by untargetting the mob via a macro, see [#19](#swifty-macro).)

- Secondary stat buff with Bloodlust: If a Bloodlust buff is up, the stat buff will last 25s instead of the default 20s, always be your highest rating and have higher prio than giving mana.

- Mana: Gives mana to a healer with less than 30% mana.

- Secondary stat buff: Grants a 20s secondary stat buff randomly selected from the player's two highest secondary stats in terms of rating.

**Notes:**
 
  - If you have a dead tank in your group the IQD will force proc an npc that is supposed to taunt the boss. (does not do anything in practice)
 
  - If your healers are below 30% mana, you can outrange them (40y range) and force it not to proc.
 
 
<div id="astral-damage">
 
## [What is Astral damage?](#astral-damage)

</div>

Astral damage is Arcane and Nature damage at the same time meaning that these spells benefit from effects that buff either spell school and double dip whenever effects that buff both are active. Mind that class buffs only affect class spells so if a trinket does nature or arcane damage they are not affected by our buffs to these spell classes.

<div id="low-dmg">
 
## [Why am I doing low damage?](#low-dmg)

<div>


This is obviously a very hard question to answer correctly without a LOT of context, but nonetheless it is probably one of the most asked questions.
Some conditionals for doing high damage as a balance druids are:
 
**Key level**
<br>The higher the key level the more you will be able to apply your dots and ramp your damage.

  **Your group composition and how to approach playing around it**
<br>A good example for this would be you doing a weekly +15 key with your venthyr moonkin friend. In a scenario like this you would want to desync your cooldowns. Most of the time, especially as a venthyr druid in lower to medium keys, you want your cooldowns to be uncontested by other people in your group, meaning that you are the only person that is using cooldowns on a pack.
 
**Your gear**
<br>Obviously, like anything else in WoW, your gear will matter no matter what. The better the gear, the more damage you will do. That being said a big trap would be chasing gear over improving personal play. You can get away with using [topgear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear) and [Droptimiser](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/droptimiser) until you reach the very high echelons of raiding or M+.

**Route and Pulls**
<br>Especially as a Venthyr, it is imperative that your tank pulls around your cooldowns, as most of your damage comes from those windows. If you have to use your cooldowns on a 3 mob pack that lasts 15 seconds you will want to Hearthstone right out of the key.

**Your own skill**
<br>Above all else, pressing your buttons correctly will net you the most damage. Refer to the [AoE priority](#aoe) for more information.

## [How to Improve in M+](#M+Improve)

<div>

If you want to push to the next level you can improve a lot by recording your gameplay. Afterwards, review the recordings while looking out for either small micro errors in your gameplay like optimization on dotting, {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} uptime, Eclipse cycling and {{< spell 197911 "AsP" >}} pooling. Be on the lookout for improvements on what trash packs to pull and how they are controlled.
 Some macro tips to look out for may include but are not limited to:
- Off-healing when necessary in order to save or stabilize a pull.
- Setting up future packs if a double pull is incoming or you are trying to skip a pack. This can be done by locking a whole pack in place by rooting/hibernating the “leader” of the pack. Most patrol packs are following one certain mob in that pack, usually the biggest mob or the one in the front. (Ether Divers in SoA)
- Utilizing {{< spell 29166 "Innervate" >}} preemptively in order for your group to be able to chain more packs and not have to wait for mana.
- Pooling AsP as a pack is dying in order to be above 50AsP before the next group of mobs to be able to maintain {{< spell 191034 "Starfall" >}} from the start.
 
 
<div id="Utility">

# [8. Utility:](#Utility)

</div>
 
 
## Balance Druid Utility:

{{< spell 29166 "Innervate" >}} - The targeted healer has no mana costs for 10sec - use on yulon monk > disc > everything else (also works with Resto Aff HotW)

{{< spell 22812 "Barkskin" >}} - 20% DR on 60sec CD (reduced by {{< spell 340529 "Tough as Bark" >}} and {{< spell 265144 "Symbol of Hope" >}}), usable while stunned, frozen, incapacitated, feared or asleep. Also prevents your casts from being pushed back.

{{< spell 3025 "Cat Form" >}} - Stance, 30% movement speed, going into or out of cat form removes slows and roots.

{{< spell 783 "Travel Form" >}} - Stance, 40% movement speed while in combat, 100% movement speed while out of combat, going into or out of travel form removes slows and roots. Keep note which fights/areas you can use this on as it’s a flat better version of Cat Form outside Dash.

{{< spell 5487 "Bear Form" >}} - Stance, 25% stamina 220% armor, stamina can be used to tank mechanics since you will be losing a smaller % of hp inside it leaving you with higher hp when you go out of it. Going into or out of bear form removes slows and roots.
