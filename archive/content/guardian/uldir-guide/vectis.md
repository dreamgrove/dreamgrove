## Talents

{{< talents spec="guardian" src="live" recommend="113,212,123,113,311,232,213" >}}

## Playstyle

Vectis deals approximately 40% Physical damage, 60% Nature damage from {{< spell 265178 "Evolving Affliction" >}}.

The forced tank swap is {{< spell 265178 "Evolving Affliction" >}}, a stacking Nature DoT. Swap on 2 to 3 stacks. One tank will have the boss, the other will be tanking any active Plague Amalgams under the boss.

Aim to keep the boss as still as possible, to not mess up the raid's handling of the {{< spell 265129 "Omega Vector" >}} debuff.

During the intermission, aim to dodge as many {{< spell 265370 "Blood Geyser" >}}s as you can, since each hit you take will give you a stack of {{< spell 265127 "Lingering Infection" >}} and increase the damage you take from {{< spell 265178 "Evolving Affliction" >}}. Also try and soak {{< spell 266948 "Plague Bomb" >}} circles where possible, but prioritize not being hit by the Geysers.

**Catweavable**: No

### Mythic

There are no significant tanking changes in Mythic.

## Tips and Tricks

Use {{< spell 106898 "Stampeding Roar" >}} during the intermission to help the raid spread out.
