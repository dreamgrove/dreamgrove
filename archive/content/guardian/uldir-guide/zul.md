## Talents

{{< talents spec="guardian" src="live" recommend="123,232,322,113,131,223,213" >}}

## Playstyle

Zul deals approximately 70% Physical damage, 30% Shadow damage from unavoidable raid damage.

In Phase 1, there is no forced tank swap. If you are tanking the Nazmani Crusher, face it away from the raid and pull it out of the group before it hits 100 energy to avoid buffing other enemies with {{< spell 273288 "Thrumming Pulse" >}}. If you are tanking the Bloodthirsty Crawgs, you can have defensives rolling to reduce the amount of leech they receive.

In Phase 2 when Zul is active, he will apply {{< spell 274358 "Rupturing Blood" >}} to the active tank. When you swap (this should be after 4-ish stacks), take the debuff out to the edge of the room and drop the pool that spawns out there. If possible, try and overlap new pools with existing pools.

Position Zul at the center of the room.

**Catweavable**: No

### Mythic

On Mythic, during Phase 1 adds can only permanently die if they are affected by {{< spell 276434 "Decaying Flesh" >}}, however --- you must ensure that at least 1 add is alive throughout Phase 1 in order to host the debuff. If all the adds die, you will lose the Decaying Flesh debuff for good and no new adds will be able to die. The strategy for keeping this buff active will depend on how your raid handles it.

## Tips and Tricks

Use {{< spell 106898 "Stampeding Roar" >}} during the intermission to help the raid spread out.

Use {{< spell 132469 "Typhoon" >}} to knock back Animated Ichors and prevent them from reaching Zul.

Use {{< spell 102793 "Ursol's Vortex" >}} to help control Crawgs.

You can use {{< spell 339 "Entangling Roots" >}} to lock down Bloodhexers if necessary.
