## Talents

{{< talents spec="guardian" src="live" recommend="113,312,132,113,311,213,213" >}}

## Playstyle

Taloc deals primarily melee damage, and a small amount of Shadow damage from the {{< spell 271296 "Cudgel of Gore" >}} mechanic. 

In phase 1, position Taloc against a wall, and aim the cudgel at the group of puddles during {{< spell 271296 "Cudgel of Gore" >}}. Return to the original position afterwards. 

In phase 2, tank the Coalesced Bloods out of the raid stack so they don't drop new pools on the group. If you are not tanking a Blood, help soak the Volatile Droplets.

Repeat the Phase 1 positioning in Phase 3.

**Catweavable**: Yes, but be ready to pick up and tank any Coalesced Bloods in Phase 3.

### Normal/Heroic
On Normal/Heroic, there is no forced tank swap mechanic. 

### Mythic
On Mythic, tanks will take {{< spell 275209 "Enlarged Heart" >}}, which they can either solo soak (by stacking cooldowns or using an immunity like {{< spell 204018 "Blessing of Spellwarding" >}}), or split with the raid group. If you are splitting with the raid, you should consider swapping when you receive the debuff.

Guardians cannot reliably solo soak Enlarged Heart without external help, so I recommend either receiving an immunity like Spellwarding, or just sharing it with the raid.  

## Tips and Tricks

Use {{< spell 132469 "Typhoon" >}} in Phase 2 to help manage the adds.

Use {{< spell 1850 "Dash" >}}/{{< spell 252216 "Tiger Dash" >}} to dodge the Cudgel during {{< spell 271296 "Cudgel of Gore" >}}. If you are quick, you can avoid taking any damage from the toss.

### Mythic
On Mythic, use {{< spell 106898 "Stampeding Roar" >}} during {{< spell 275189 "Hardened Arteries" >}} to help your raid with spreading out.
