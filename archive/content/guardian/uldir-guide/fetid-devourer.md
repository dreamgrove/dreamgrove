## Talents

{{< talents spec="guardian" src="live" recommend="113,212,123,113,311,232,213" >}}

## Playstyle

Fetid Devourer deals entirely Physical damage, almost entirely from melees (or Terrible Thrash {{< spell 262277 "Terrible Thrash" >}}).

There is no forced tank swap on this fight. This encounter does require two tanks due to {{< spell 262277 "Terrible Thrash" >}} --- every fourth melee, the boss will attack the nearest person to the tank for 300% of a normal melee. The two tanks must be on top of each other at all times. {{< spell 203974 "Earthwarden" >}} *does not* work against Terrible Thrash.

When the Corruption Corpuscles spawn, it may be optimal to drag the boss to one of them to maximize cleave. Otherwise, tank the boss in the center of the room to minimize travel time.

**Catweavable**: No

### Mythic

It is recommended that the boss be dragged on top of the Mutated Mass for maximum DPS.

## Tips and Tricks

Use {{< spell 106898 "Stampeding Roar" >}} during {{< spell 262291 "Rotting Regurgitation" >}} to help the raid manage their movement, or when Corruption Corpuscles spawn.

You can use {{< spell 106839 "Skull Bash" >}} or {{< spell 16979 "Wild Charge" >}} during {{< spell 262288 "Shockwave Stomp" >}} to quickly return to the boss, although keep your co-tank's movement options in mind as well; if they are not able to keep up with you, it's better to get knocked back with them.
### Tanking Terrible Thrash

While guardians are more suited to the main tank role due to gaining resources from being melee'd and their high uptime active mitigation, it is completely viable to have Guardian tank the {{< spell 262277 "Terrible Thrash" >}} mechanic.

If you are the designated off tank, you will be taking a {{< spell 262277 "Terrible Thrash" >}} every 6 seconds. You *must* be topped off before each one, and have at a bare minimum 1 stack of {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}} (ideally 2 or more). To be extra safe, you should cover any Thrashes where you only have 1 stack with {{< spell 22812 "Barkskin" >}} or an external cooldown, and if you can't have Ironfur up for a Thrash use {{< spell 61336 "Survival Instincts" >}}. 

To get the most out of {{< spell 155835 "Bristling Fur" >}}, you should use it right before {{< spell 262277 "Terrible Thrash" >}} so that it covers two casts. Bristling Fur will cap your Rage both times you get hit, which will help you maintain your 2 stacks of {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}}. 

Be aware of Fetid's spell queueing as well; {{< spell 262277 "Terrible Thrash" >}} is one of the lowest priority spells, meaning he can (and will) cast any of his other abilities before Terrible Thrash even though the timers indicate Terrible Thrash is coming next. If you can, try and avoid spending Rage/using cooldowns until he actually starts the Terrible Thrash cast.

Use the downtime during the {{< spell 262370 "Consume Corruption" >}} cast to catch up on Rage generation.
