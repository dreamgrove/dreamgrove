## Talents

{{< talents spec="guardian" src="live" recommend="113,212,122,113,131,132,213" >}}

## Playstyle

The Mythrax encounter deals approximately 50% Physical damage and 50% Shadow damage from {{< spell 273282 "Essence Shear" >}}.

In Phase 1, the forced tank swap is {{< spell 273282 "Essence Shear" >}}, which gives you 15 stacks of {{< spell 272336 "Annihilation" >}} and prevents you from generating further {{< spell 272480 "Existence Fragments" >}} for 25 seconds. Swap when this is cast, then the off tank will gather fragments to clear their stacks. Tank Mythrax facing a wall to not cleave people with Essence Shear.

In Phase 2, there is no tank swap. The N'raqi Destroyer adds will continue to cast {{< spell 273282 "Essence Shear" >}}, but since both tanks are receiving it they cannot swap. One Destroyer should be tanked in the raid group and the other 40 yards away to prevent {{< spell 276900 "Critical Mass" >}}.

**Catweavable**: Yes, in Phase 1.

### Mythic

There are no significant tanking changes in Mythic. Be aware that {{< spell 272480 "Existence Fragments" >}} can now be cleared by encounter mechanics, so you may struggle to clear your stacks completely as the fight progresses.


## Tips and Tricks

Use {{< spell 106898 "Stampeding Roar" >}} to help the raid dodge {{< spell 274113 "Obliteration Beam" >}}.

Use {{< spell 132469 "Typhoon" >}} to knock charmed players out of {{< spell 272407 "Oblivion Sphere" >}}s.
