description: Recommendations for Guardian Druid talents, and playstyle, and tips and tricks for MOTHER in Uldir, on Normal/Heroic and Mythic difficulties.
---

## Talents

{{< talents spec="guardian" src="live" recommend="113,212,122,113,311,213,213" >}}

## Playstyle

MOTHER deals primarily melee damage, and a small amount of Arcane damage from raid members triggering {{< spell 267821 "Defense Grid" >}} when crossing into other chambers.

There is no forced tank swap on MOTHER; she will occasionally cast {{< spell 267787 "Sanitizing Strike" >}} at the tank but this is avoidable. 

Position MOTHER close to the force field leading to the next chamber, so the melee don't have to run too far to cross over. Face her away from the raid to prevent them from getting cleaved by {{< spell 267787 "Sanitizing Strike" >}}. 

**Catweavable**: Yes

### Mythic

When tanks cross through the defense grid they spawn a special tank add (The Resistant Bacterium) which  will cast {{< spell 279669 "Bacterial Outbreak" >}}. This add is top priority when it spawns.

## Tips and Tricks

Use {{< spell 106898 "Stampeding Roar" >}} during {{< spell 267878 "Wind Tunnel" >}} to help the raid manage their movement.

Use {{< spell 132469 "Typhoon" >}} to interrupt the adds spellcasts.
