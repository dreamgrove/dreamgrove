## Talents

{{< talents spec="guardian" src="live" recommend="113,232,122,113,311,232,213" >}}

## Playstyle

Zek'voz deals approximately 70% Physical damage, 30% Magic damage from {{< spell 265264 "Void Lash" >}}.

The forced tank swap is the tank combo {{< spell 267312 "Might of the Void" >}}, which consists of the sequence {{< spell 265264 "Void Lash" >}} -> {{< spell 265248 "Shatter" >}} -> {{< spell 265264 "Void Lash" >}}.

There are two ways to manage this combo. You can either take the full sequence and then swap after the second {{< spell 265264 "Void Lash" >}}, at which point the tank who took the combo will have 100% reduced healing for 8 seconds. ({{< spell 265264 "Void Lash" >}} -> {{< spell 265248 "Shatter" >}} -> {{< spell 265264 "Void Lash" >}} -> Taunt)

Alternatively, you can swap after the {{< spell 265248 "Shatter" >}} cast so that you split the two reduced healing debuffs, meaning each tank will have 50% reduced healing ({{< spell 265264 "Void Lash" >}} -> {{< spell 265248 "Shatter" >}} -> Taunt -> {{< spell 265264 "Void Lash" >}}).

Which strategy is right for you will depend on your tank composition and what your healers are most comfortable with. Guardians are able to have {{< spell 22812 "Barkskin" >}} for every other sequence, and can cover the scarier overlaps with {{< spell 61336 "Survival Instincts" >}}. Depending on tuning, this may be enough to reliably manage every combo, but you should confer with your co-tank and healers to work out the ideal strategy for your raid.

Position the boss in the center of the room, between the raid and the spawn locations for the Silithid Warriors.

In Phase 2, drag the boss onto the nearest Nerubian Voidweaver to maximize cleave.

**Catweavable**: Yes

### Mythic

In Mythic, the Voidweavers are present in Phase 1 and Phase 2. There are no significant tanking changes in Mythic.

## Tips and Tricks

Use {{< spell 106898 "Stampeding Roar" >}} during {{< spell 265451 "Surging Darkness" >}} to help the raid dodge the rings.

Use {{< spell 132469 "Typhoon" >}} to reposition the Voidweavers if necessary.

Use {{< spell 102793 "Ursol's Vortex" >}} to control the small adds.
