{{< spell 106839 "Skull Bash" >}} – your basic interrupt. Can be used from slightly-further-than-melee-range away from the target (and more, if using {{< spell 197632 "Balance Affinity" >}}).

{{< spell 99 "Incapacitating Roar" >}} – This is an aoe disorient. This is especially useful for stopping enemies from casting when you can’t ordinarily interrupt them, or when there are too many to interrupt all the casts. Note that if you are talented into {{< spell 197488 "Balance Affinity" >}}, the range of this ability is increased, and it can pull enemies from places you were not expecting. This spell is replaced if you are talented by {{< spell 236748 "Intimidating Roar" >}} if you are talented into it. Intimidating Roar changes the classification from a disorient to a fear, and causes enemies to cower in place.

{{< spell 106898 "Stampeding Roar" >}} – Very useful ability in certain raid encounters; and just generally good to have in dungeons.

{{< spell 5211 "Mighty Bash" >}} (talent) – Single target stun.

{{< spell 132469 "Typhoon" >}} (talent) – AoE knockback; particularly useful for dungeons where you need to kite the enemies.

{{< spell 102359 "Mass Entanglement" >}} (talent) – AoE root. Usually not very good, in certain specific situations it can be very useful, such as on Coven of Shivarra or Aggramar, both from the Antorus raid.

{{< spell 20484 "Rebirth" >}} – Combat resurrection.

{{< spell 5215 "Prowl" >}} – Stealth. Can be useful in some dungeons.

{{< spell 1850 "Dash" >}} – Makes you enter cat form and gives you high movement speed whilst in cat form. You do not need to be in cat form to cast it in the first place. This spell is replaced by {{< spell 252216 "Tiger Dash" >}} if you are talented into it. Tiger Dash provides faster movement speed that decays over a shorter period of time, with a shorter cooldown.

{{< spell 2908 "Soothe" >}} - Dispels all enrage effects on a single enemy. This is particularly useful in dungeons, as there are a lot of enrage effects in BfA dungeons and especially against the mythic+ affix Raging, which is dispellable.

{{< spell 132302 "Wild Charge" >}} - A personal mobility spell. Its effect changes based on the form you are in. In Bear Form, it charges you at an enemy and immobilizes them for 4 seconds.
