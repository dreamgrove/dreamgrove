### Talents for beginners

These are not necessarily the best talents to use in any particular situation. They are, however, the simplest to play and will be effective enough in most situations.

 - {{< spell 203962 "Blood Frenzy" >}}
 - {{< spell 204012 "Guttural Roars" >}}
 - {{< spell 197632 "Balance Affinity" >}}
 - {{< spell 5211 "Mighty Bash" >}}
 - {{< spell 158477 "Soul of the Forest" >}}
 - {{< spell 203974 "Earthwarden" >}}
 - {{< spell 204053 "Rend and Tear" >}}

### Rotation for beginners

Again it must be stressed that this rotation is not necessarily the actual best rotation you ought to be using, either for survivability or DPS, in any particular circumstance. However if you are new to the spec or to the game it will perform adequately for many purposes, and help whilst you familiarise yourself with what your abilities do.

 - {{< spell 33917 "Mangle" >}} on cooldown -> {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} on cooldown -> Use {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} if it’s not up on the target or is about to run out -> {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}}.

 - Make sure all Global Cooldowns are filled by queueing abilities, i.e. press the button just before it’s ready. You should never have gaps in between casts.

 - Use {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}} when you are taking physical damage, and use {{< spell 22842 "Frenzied Regeneration" >}} when you need healing.

 - Use {{< spell 22812 "Barkskin" >}} when you are taking significant damage.

 - Use {{< spell 61336 "Survival Instincts" >}} when you are about to take extremely heavy damage and you are not sure that you will survive without it.

 - Try not to use multiple Damage Reduction cooldowns together unless you think you need to do that in order to survive.
