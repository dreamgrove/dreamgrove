### Level 15
{{< talent-row spec="guardian" tier="15" >}}

{{< spell 203953 "Brambles" >}} generally provides the highest DPS, since it gives more throughput than the extra {{< spell 6807 "Maul" >}}s you would get from the rage gained through the alternatives.

{{< spell 155835 "Bristling Fur" >}} is generally the best choice for survivability. It generates rage based on damage taken after mitigation, so you will generate a lot more rage if you use it with zero stacks or one stack of {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}} up compared to two or three. It’s best used immediately preceding a period of very heavy physical damage.

{{< spell 155835 "Bristling Fur" >}} hypothetically can be strongest for DPS on single target if you are taking an extremely large amount of damage, and not spending rage on {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}}. This will allow you to generate extra rage for additional casts of {{< spell 6807 "Maul" >}}. However, the benefit from the additional casts of {{< spell 6807 "Maul" >}} is actually quite low unless you are directly replacing a cast of {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}} in your rotation - if you are delaying {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} or {{< spell 33917 "Mangle" >}} then the marginal gain is much lower. You also need to ensure you don’t waste any rage. In practice it is extremely hard, if not impossible, for {{< spell 155835 "Bristling Fur" >}} to beat {{< spell 203953 "Brambles" >}} in terms of DPS.

{{< spell 203962 "Blood Frenzy" >}} can be worth taking when you have several targets within {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} range throughout the entire encounter. It may be worth using on very high fortified mythic+ dungeons, as enemies survive a reasonably long time, and do damage in a constant manner rather than in short bursts. It is generally not worth taking on fewer than 3 constant targets.

### Level 30
{{< talent-row spec="guardian" tier="30" >}}

{{< spell 132302 "Wild Charge" >}} is versatile movement cooldown and should be your default choice.

{{< spell 252216 "Tiger Dash" >}} may see use in situations where you need a very frequent movement speed burst, and can afford to be out of {{< spell 5487 "Bear Form" >}}.

{{< spell 236748 "Intimidating Roar" >}} is usually a poor choice. Many enemies can be disoriented by {{< spell 99 "Incapacitating Roar" >}} but not by {{< spell 236748 "Intimidating Roar" >}}, so it actually reduces your utility in those situations.


### Level 45
{{< talent-row spec="guardian" tier="45" >}}

{{< spell 197492 "Restoration Affinity" >}} is a sensible default option if you are looking for any additional survivability. The healing it provides is rarely operative or overly impactful, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t there.

{{< spell 197488 "Balance Affinity" >}} is not as good at 3 yards as it was at 5 yards. It can still be useful in specific situations where you need the range, but it should not be the default in all cases anymore.

{{< spell 202155 "Feral Affinity" >}} is useful for certain situations where the extra movement speed helps deal with a particular mechanic. It is also a required talent for catweaving, as it enables the Cat Form bleeds.

### Level 60
{{< talent-row spec="guardian" tier="60" >}}

{{< spell 132469 "Typhoon" >}} will be the most generally useful, although {{< spell 5211 "Mighty Bash" >}} and {{< spell 102359 "Mass Entanglement" >}} can be extremely good in certain specific situations.

### Level 75
{{< talent-row spec="guardian" tier="75" >}}

{{< spell 158477 "Soul of the Forest" >}} is the best talent defensively and offensively on exactly one target. If there are two or more targets or you are catweaving, {{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}} outperforms Soul offensively and defensively.

For extreme burst aoe, {{< spell 102558 "Incarnation: Guardian of Ursoc" >}} is better for that particular period whilst it’s up. Naturally you lose a significant amount of DPS whilst it’s on cooldown, but this may still be worth it depending on your pulls. To best make use of {{< spell 102558 "Incarnation: Guardian of Ursoc" >}}, you should use it on a large pull when your DPS do not have their cooldowns ready.

### Level 90
{{< talent-row spec="guardian" tier="90" >}}

{{< spell 155578 "Guardian of Elune" >}} is ordinarily the best talent. It does not matter if you waste procs - this is irrelevant even in optimal play. To use it optimally, try to ensure that every {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}} and {{< spell 22842 "Frenzied Regeneration" >}} you cast is buffed by {{< spell 155578 "Guardian of Elune" >}} - though naturally sometimes you will need to forego this in order to survive, and that’s fine.

{{< spell 203974 "Earthwarden" >}} is ordinarily not very good. It will provide less mitigation than {{< spell 155578 "Guardian of Elune" >}} in most situations. However, it shines when you are able to hit multiple enemies with {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}}, but are only taking hits from some of them, because they don’t melee you or because someone else is tanking them.

{{< spell 203965 "Survival of the Fittest" >}} is a minor DPS increase when paired with {{< spell 203953 "Brambles" >}}. It’s very minor, and if survivability is a concern at all, then it is not recommended for these purposes.

{{< spell 203965 "Survival of the Fittest" >}} is generally very weak for survivability. It is only useful (but does become the best talent) if you gain additional casts of {{< spell 61336 "Survival Instincts" >}} throughout the encounter that you actually need in order to survive particular boss mechanics.

### Level 100
{{< talent-row spec="guardian" tier="100" >}}

{{< spell 80313 "Pulverize" >}} is the best talent for survivability. For DPS, one one target it is very slightly ahead of {{< spell 204053 "Rend and Tear" >}} provided you execute the rotation optimally. It is far worse on two or more targets.

{{< spell 204053 "Rend and Tear" >}} is worse defensively than {{< spell 80313 "Pulverize" >}} in all situations. Offensively Rend and Tear is superior to Pulverize and is recommended even on single target, since it is very nearly even {{< spell 80313 "Pulverize" >}} when Pulverize is executed perfectly, and Rend and Tear requires far less effort to play.

{{< spell 204066 "Lunar Beam" >}} is the strongest ability for DPS on 6 or more targets, which could make it useful in certain dungeons. Defensively, it does not hold a candle to the other two.
