## Bear Only

The following rotation is identical for both survivability and DPS, with the exception of what to spend Rage on. 

Offensively, you should cast Maul to replace a Swipe, or immediately to avoid Rage capping.

Defensively, You should use {{< spell 192081 "Ironfur" >}} when you are about to take physical damage, and you should use {{< spell 22842 "Frenzied Regeneration" >}} when you think you won't cause overhealing for you or your healers by using it.

{{< expandable "1 target" >}}
  1. Maintain {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}.
  2. Use {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} to build stacks if the target is not already at maximum stacks.
  3. Use {{< spell 80313 "Pulverize" >}} when your target is at maximum stacks, if talented.
  4. Use {{< spell 33917 "Mangle" >}} if the target is bleeding.
  5. Cast {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} when you have a {{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}} proc.
  6. Use {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}}.
  7. Fill with {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}}.
{{< /expandable >}}

{{< expandable "2 targets" >}}
  1. Maintain {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}.
  2. Use {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} to build stacks if the target is not already at maximum stacks.
  4. Use {{< spell 33917 "Mangle" >}} if the target is bleeding.
  5. Cast {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} when you have a {{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}} proc.
  6. Use {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}}.
  7. Fill with {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}}.
{{< /expandable >}}

{{< expandable "3 targets" >}}
  1. Maintain {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}}.
  5. Cast {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} when you have a {{< spell 203964 "Galactic Guardian" >}} proc.
  6. Use {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}}.
  7. Fill with {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}}.
{{< /expandable >}}

{{< expandable "4+ targets" >}}
  6. Use {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}}.
  7. Fill with {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}}.
{{< /expandable >}}

If you are using {{< spell 102558 "Incarnation: Guardian of Ursoc" >}}, you should spam {{< spell 33917 "Mangle" >}} at 1-3 targets, and {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}} at 4 or more. While Incarnation is active, only maintain {{< spell 8921 "Moonfire" >}} on single target.

When using {{< spell 80313 "Pulverize" >}}, ideally you cast it on a global where you would have otherwise cast {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}}, and before the next {{< spell 77758 "Thrash" >}}, in order to not waste stacks.

## Catweaving

If you are catweaving, your rotation should be similar to the single target rotation above, except when you reach the point where you cannot cast anything but {{< spell 213764 "Swipe" >}}, you instead shift into {{< spell 768 "Cat Form" >}} and begin a "cat cycle".

Cat cycles last until you run out of energy (after which you switch back into {{< spell 5487 "Bear Form" >}}), and obey the following priority list:

- If you are at 5 combo points:
  - If {{< spell 1079 "Rip" >}} is ticking and your target is below 25% health:
    - Cast {{< spell 22568 "Ferocious Bite" >}}.
  - If {{< spell 1079 "Rip" >}} is not ticking, in pandemic, or will fall off before your next chance to refresh:
    - Cast {{< spell 1079 "Rip" >}}.
  - Otherwise:
    - Cast {{< spell 22568 "Ferocious Bite" >}}.
- Otherwise:
  - If {{< spell 1822 "Rake" >}} is not ticking, in pandemic, or will fall off before your next chance to refresh:
    - Cast {{< spell 1822 "Rake" >}}.
  - Otherwise:
    - Cast {{< spell 5221 "Shred" >}}.

Note that below 25% health, provided you won't die by doing so, it is worth dropping everything to maintain a ticking {{< spell 1079 "Rip" >}} by shifting into {{< spell 768 "Cat Form" >}}, and applying a 1 combo point {{< spell 22568 "Ferocious Bite" >}} to refresh the duration of Rip, then shifting back into Bear Form.
