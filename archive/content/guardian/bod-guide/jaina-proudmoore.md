## Talents

{{< talents spec="guardian" src="live" recommend="113,113,113,113,231,213,312" >}}

## Playstyle

*Disclaimer: there is no publicly available testing data about the final phase of this encounter, so what follows is only what is theorized to be the case from the dungeon journal.*

Throughout the fight, the tanks will swap in order to manage their {{< spell 285212 "Chilling Touch" >}} stacks. Jaina casts {{< spell 285253 "Ice Shard" >}} at her target, which applies one stack of Chilling Touch. Each phase has different ways of dropping your Chilling Touch stacks. You will not gain stacks in either intermission.

In Phase 1, you can drop your stacks using {{< spell 287365 "Searing Pitch" >}}. You will want to swap whenever a Searing Pitch is available to drop stacks on.

In Phase 2, you will drop your stacks using the barrels of Unexploded Ordnance (when they explode, they cast {{< spell 288221 "Burning Explosion" >}}). How often you detonate one of these will depend on your raid's strategy, as everyone else is also dealing with the same debuff.

In Phase 3, you are no longer able to drop your stacks. This means you will need someone to break you out of your ice block when you reach 20 {{< spell 285212 "Chilling Touch" >}}. Additionally you will gain stacks faster from Jaina's {{< spell 288747 "Prismatic Image" >}}. You will have to decide how and when to deliberately be frozen, and this will be dependent on your raid's strategy.

**Catweavable**: In Phase 2.

## Tips and Tricks

Use {{< spell 106898 "Stampeding Roar" >}} during the first Intermission to help your raid get through the fog and to the boss.
