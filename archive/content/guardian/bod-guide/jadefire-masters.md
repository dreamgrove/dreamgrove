## Talents

{{< talents spec="guardian" src="live" recommend="113,113,113,113,231,123,312" >}}

## Playstyle

The tank swap mechanic is {{< spell 284028 "Multi-Sided Strike" >}}, in which the Monk teleports his target into the air and the player must block the incoming clones. Once this sequence has completed (regardless of if you succeed or fail), you will gain {{< spell 288151 "Tested" >}} at which point you should swap bosses. 

Note that the Mage also has a tank swap mechanic in her stacking debuff {{< spell 282037 "Rising Flames" >}}, but swapping on every {{< spell 284028 "Multi-Sided Strike" >}} seems sufficient for also dealing with this mechanic.

**Catweavable**: No.

## Tips and Tricks

Use {{< spell 106898 "Stampeding Roar" >}} during the Maze phase to help your raid move through the maze faster.
