## Talents

{{< talents spec="guardian" src="live" recommend="113,113,113,113,231,123,312" >}}

## Playstyle

Every 30 seconds, Grong will perform {{< spell 282082 "Bestial Combo" >}}, a series of 4 attacks randomly chosen between {{< spell 283078 "Bestial Smash" >}} and {{< spell 285875 "Rending Bite" >}} (although you cannot get more than 2 {{< spell 283078 "Bestial Smash" >}}es per combo). 

Your tank swap should be performed such that one tank never takes more than 1 {{< spell 283078 "Bestial Smash" >}} per combo, while also equally distributing stacks of {{< spell 285875 "Rending Bite" >}}. 

**Catweavable**: Maybe.

### Mythic

On Mythic difficulty, abilities during the combo occur faster (1.5 second casts, down from 2 second casts).
