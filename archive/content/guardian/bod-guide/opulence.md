## Talents

{{< talents spec="guardian" src="live" recommend="113,132,113,113,231,213,312" >}}

## Playstyle

In Phase 1 there is no forced tank swap, as you will be split into separate groups. Once you meet up in Phase 2, you will want to swap 
whenever your {{< spell 284527 "Diamond of the Unshakeable Protector" >}} is off cooldown. 

In Heroic and Mythic, you will want to use {{< spell 284527 "Diamond of the Unshakeable Protector" >}} to mitigate the {{< spell 287037 "Coin Sweep" >}} hit.

**Catweavable**: In Phase 2.

## Tips and Tricks

Use {{< spell 106898 "Stampeding Roar" >}} to help your group avoid Phase 1 mechanics such as {{< spell 282939 "Flames of Punishment" >}}. In Phase 2, use Roar to help players affected by {{< spell 287072 "Liquid Gold" >}} to take their debuffs out.

When {{< spell 285995 "Spirits of Gold" >}} is cast in Phase 2, use {{< spell 102793 "Ursol's Vortex" >}} to round up the adds and prevent them from moving to the edges of the room.
