## Talents

{{< talents spec="guardian" src="live" recommend="132,132,113,113,131,312,312" >}}

## Playstyle

Of the four aspects, only two will be active at a time. They must be tanked at least 7 yards apart or they will gain {{< spell 282079 "Loa's Pact" >}}, reducing their damage taken and increasing their damage dealt by 90%. Once an aspect dies, the other will be healed to full and another will enter the fight.

There are two aspects that have tank swap mechanics. 

Pa'ku's aspect gains a stacking haste buff {{< spell 285945 "Hastening Winds" >}} for each consecutive hit on the same target. There are two ways to deal with this; you can either tank swap, or you can have a DPS taunt, eat a melee, and then taunt back to reset the stacks. Both strategies are viable.

Kimbul's aspect casts a stacking debuff {{< spell 282444 "Lacerating Claws" >}}, and will force you to perform a full tank swap (you will want to swap whenever your stacks fall off).

**Catweavable**: No.

## Tips and Tricks

Use {{< spell 106898 "Stampeding Roar" >}} during {{< spell 282107 "Paku's Wrath" >}} to assist the raid in moving to the safe spot.

Use {{< spell 132469 "Typhoon" >}} and {{< spell 102793 "Ursol's Vortex" >}} to control the raptors during {{< spell 282155 "Gonk's Wrath" >}}.

On Mythic difficulty, if you can do so safely, you are able to dispel {{< spell 286672 "Bwonsamdi's Wrath" >}} with {{< spell 2782 "Remove Corruption" >}}. Keep in mind that this will take you out of {{< spell 5487 "Bear Form" >}}, so only do this if you are not at risk of being hit while out of form.
