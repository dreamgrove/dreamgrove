## Talents

{{< talents spec="guardian" src="live" recommend="113,123,113,113,231,312,312" >}}

## Playstyle

The tanks will be split up, one tanking the boss and the other the adds some distance away. 

There is a mechanic that is intended to force a tank swap, {{< spell 283572 "Sacred Blade" >}}, which will stack up on the boss tank. This debuff needs to be dropped periodically to reduce incoming damage; you can either do this by moving far away during one of her long Seal casts, and letting the debuff fall off while she runs towards you, OR by having the add tank taunt at specific times and take hits until the debuff has expired.

**Catweavable**: No.

### Mythic

On Mythic, the boss will cast {{< spell 287469 "Prayer for the Fallen" >}}. During this time all adds (alive or dead) will channel a spell. Of note for the add tank is the Crusaders, which channel {{< spell 287439 "Divine Mallet" >}}, which sends hammers out in all directions that deal huge damage to anyone hit. It is imperative that these adds die in a single location, far away from the raid stack and the boss, to make these hammers predictable and easy to dodge.

## Tips and Tricks

As the add tank, use {{< spell 132469 "Typhoon" >}} to re-position Crusaders before they die.
