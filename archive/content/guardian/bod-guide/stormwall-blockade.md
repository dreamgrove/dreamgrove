## Talents

{{< talents spec="guardian" src="live" recommend="113,113,113,113,231,213,312" >}}

## Playstyle

In Phase 1, there is no tank swap mechanic, as you will be split up into separate groups.

In Phase 2, Laminaria will apply stacks of {{< spell 285000 "Kelp-Wrapped" >}} to the active tank. You will want to swap in such a way that the tank with stacks is able to move out to where the Energized Storm add spawns and drop their debuff onto that add (this may involve swapping a few seconds before the add spawns so that there is time to run out).

**Catweavable**: In Phase 2.

## Tips and Tricks

In Phase 1, when Sister Katherine is on your ship, use {{< spell 106898 "Stampeding Roar" >}} during {{< spell 284262 "Voltaic Flash" >}} to help your raid dodge the orb waves.
