<BossCard title="Trash">
- On the first pull you can theoretically full pull whole room if you have enough CCs and interrupts for <Wowhead type="npc" id="151657"/>'s !301088|Detonate!. However, usually, the time saved is not worth the risk.
- [*Balance] Use !Solar Beam! on <Wowhead type="npc" id="151657"/>'s !301088|Detonate! casts and try to not overlap it with other interrupts.
- [*~Guardian] <Wowhead type="npc" id="151773"/>: Use defensive cooldowns at 2-3 stacks of !1217821|Fiery Jaws!.
- You can use !Ursol's Vortex! to prevent <Wowhead type="npc" id="151773"/> from jumping with !1217821|Fiery Jaws!.
- Don't focus the <Wowhead type="npc" id="144299"/>s. They spawn <Wowhead type="npc" id="151579"/>s that will cast !293724|Shield Generator! which provides a 75% DR if you stand in it.
- You can skip the second to last pack on last platform with stealth by walking around to the right.
</BossCard>

<BossCard title="The Platinum Pummeler" id="144244">
- [*~Guardian] Bait bombs away from melee.
- [*~Guardian] For avoiding <Wowhead type="npc" id="145185"/>'s attacks you can use !Wild Charge! relatively fast, but be careful of the bombs. 
</BossCard>

<BossCard title="K.U.-J.0" id="144246">
- Get a dungeon weakaura pack with an indicator that tells you if you are safe from !291946|Venting Flames!. Box angles are fake and you can cast while protected.
- You can't !58984|Shadowmeld! !292022|Explosive Leap! so don't bait it on the boxes.
</BossCard>

<BossCard title="Head Machinist Sparkflux" id="144248">
- [*~Guardian] !284885|Self Trimming Hedge! can one shot, but at 660 ilvl in a +10 you drop to about 20% health.
- All damage except for !285443|Hidden Flame Cannon! is avoidable.
</BossCard>

<BossCard title="King Mechagon" id="152619">
- [*~Guardian] !291928|Mega-Zap! can be !58984|Shadowmeld!ed, otherwise use defensive cooldowns.
- !283534|Magneto Arm! has fall-off damage. Position yourself on the opposite side of the arm, but in melee range.
</BossCard>
