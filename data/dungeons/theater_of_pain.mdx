<BossCard title="Gorechop" id="162317">
- Try to stay as much as possible in melee range.
- Kill the <Wowhead type="npc" id="165260"/>s close to existing puddles as they will drop !321447|Coagulating Ooze! on death.

- [*DPS] <Wowhead type="npc" id="165260"/>'s will lose 2% of their health every 1s because of !323542|Oozing! so killing them incredibly quickly is not required and you can passively cleave them.
- [*Balance] Save AP and !Wild Charge! for dodging the !322795|Meat Hooks!.
- [*Resto] Focus heals on players hit by !322795|Meat Hook! since they will receive !323406|Jagged Gash! for 8s. Usually 1/2 !Rejuvenation!s and !Lifebloom! or !Cenarion Ward! will be enough, but on higher keys you might need to spam !Regrowth! on them.

- [*DPS] Exit any shapeshift form if you're selected for !320102|Blood and Glory! and you intend to die. 
- [*DPS] Winning !320102|Blood and Glory! will give you !320165|Glorified! for 20s granting you a 10% dps buff, so avoid using any CDs during the pvp phase.
