This page should serve as an evergreen hub and an explainer for the best guides and resources available for Resto Druid Raid and M+ gameplay.

# Major Guides

Our official guides are all complementary, so you should read them all.

- **[Wowhead](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/classes/druid/restoration/overview-pve-healer)**: Resto Druid pages on Wowhead are written and kept up-to-date by Voulk. They will always include an overview of meta/starter talent builds, gear, rotations, and general gameplay tips. 

- **[Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/restoration-druid-pve-healing-guide)**: Resto Druid pages on Icy Veins are written and kept up-to-date by Torty. His write-ups build on foundational class knowledge and offer more in-depth explanations on optimising our kit for different content and scenarios.
  - Manaforge Omega encounter guide by Torty (Resto Druid specific advice) will be linked here when live
  - [Resto Druid DPS in PvE content](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/restoration-druid-pve-dps-guide) by Torty

- **[Questionably Epic](https://questionablyepic.com/resto-druid/spells/)**: Resto Druid pages on Questionably Epic are written by Voulk. He gave the site an enormous update ahead of Patch 11.1! Please go check it out.
  - [Manaforge Omega encounter guide](https://questionablyepic.com/manaforge-omega/) by Broccoliz (general guide)

# Quick Offspec Guide

Have you been asked to Offspec Resto Druid on incredibly short notice? Here are standard talent strings to use for Raid and M+ respectively, along with the most important interactions in our kit for both content types.

> [!WARNING]
> If you have more than a few minutes to prepare to heal, or you need more than a few bullet points on the class to perform to the expected extent, you should seriously consider reviewing at least one of the Major Guides linked above instead.

## Raid Healing

<Talents name="Raid Talent Build" talents="CkGAkuH5GdQpDrgY32rlVGnyqtNmZGLbjZmxiZb4BYstNzyitZAAAAAAAAAAAAsNoZjx0MMwsMz2MzYGzMDAAAAAAAAwyyYBTzMLDBAgAWYMDwMwoB"/>

```
CkGAkuH5GdQpDrgY32rlVGnyqtNmZGLbjZmxiZb4BYstNzyitZAAAAAAAAAAAAsNoZjx0MMwsMz2MzYGzMDAAAAAAAAwyyYBTzMLDBAgAWYMDwMwoB
```

In Raid, we ramp in one minute intervals around !Flourish!. Here is the sequence you are looking to emulate:
- Spread !Rejuvenation! around the raid 15-20 seconds before major damage events
- Always !Swiftmend! before !Wild Growth! to benefit from !Soul of the Forest!
- Send all !Grove Guardians! charges in the last oGCDs of your ramp
- Cast !Convoke the Spirits! and then !Flourish! as the damage event starts

## M+ Healing

<Talents name="M+ Talent Build"  talents="CkGAkuH5GdQpDrgY32rlVGnyqtxMzYxMzMzsY2GDGLLjtFbzAAAAAAAAAAAAYbQ2MMZYmZMLmtZGmxMzAAAAAAAADgllxCmmZWGCAmtZ2a2mZzGjZghZB0A"/>

```

```

- Maintain !Lifebloom! uptime on two DPS and !Efflorescence! uptime in melee 
- Use !Swiftmend! before !Regrowth! on a non-Lifebloom target to benefit from !Rampant Growth!
- Spread !Rejuvenation! to prepare for heavy-hitting Boss abilities
- Cast !Convoke the Spirits! for big healing on the entire group


# Resto Druid BiS Gear

All Wowhead and Icy Veins class guides always have "BiS" lists, but we **only** want to use them to get an idea of what pieces we will find valuable. As Resto Druids, we **always** use the tools in the "Simming" section below to determine what gear to equip and where we might find upgrades.


# "Simming" Resto Druid

It's not actually simming, but it's the closest we've got. Your [SimC](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/simulationcraft) output can be used on the following websites:

## Questionably Epic Live

**[Questionably Epic Live](https://questionablyepic.com/live/)** (QELive): QELive was created by Voulk and is our resource that is always kept most up-to-date. Select the Dungeon or Raid setting at the top of the page, and use the Top Gear module to find your best set of gear based on everything you own and put into it. Top Gear supports set bonuses, stat diminishing returns, special effects, Great Vault exclusivity, and more.

### QELive basics
  - The Dungeon setting can be further configured to "Healing focused" or "Balanced" mode
  - For the Raid setting, insert a log using the button in the top right for increased accuracy

### QELive notable pages
  - [Trinkets graph](https://questionablyepic.com/live/trinkets) with Optional Settings for individual vs. group benefit, etc.
  - [Embellishments graph](https://questionablyepic.com/live/embellishments) with tabs for HPS, DPS, and a combination of both
  - [Upgrade finder](https://questionablyepic.com/live/upgradeFinder) with filters for content types and difficulty levels

For further support, refer to Voulk's [tutorial](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/how-to-use-qe-live-tool-guide) on all of QELive's tools and check out the [QELive Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/jBSGHDm5G8).

## Raidbots

**[Raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/)**: Raidbots is the default resource for simulating Resto Druid damage, particularly for use in M+.


# Other Resources

## WoWAnalyzer

Resto Druids can use [WoWAnalyzer](https://wowanalyzer.com/) to receive general feedback on [Logs](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/how-to-use-warcraft-logs-6341). If you haven't uploaded any Logs yourself, you should still search your character name on Warcraft Logs to see if anyone has logged any content with you. Our WoWAnalyzer modules are maintained by Sref.

## Addons

Many Resto Druids find third-party Raid and Party frames to be more useful than Blizzard's stock UI for tracking our many HoTs. Popular frame Addons include Cell, Grid2, ElvUI, and VuhDo. We all use different stuff and don't endorse any one singular profile, so you will need to do some groundwork to find the config that works best for you.

  - [Wowhead](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/classes/druid/restoration/best-weakauras-macros-addons) page for Resto Druid UI resources
  - [Questionably Epic](https://questionablyepic.com/resto-druid/userInterface) page for Resto Druid UI resources
  - If you see someone playing with a complete UI or Raid/Party frames you like but cannot find on your own, consider asking directly for the profile, like in their stream chat or comment section

If for whatever reason you really just want to use Blizzard's stock frames, you **will** need at least one of the following Addons to extend their functionality:

  - [RaidFrameSettings](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/raid-frame-settings)
  - [Enhanced Raid Frames](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/enhanced-raid-frames)
  - [BigDebuffs](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bigdebuffs)


## WeakAuras

We all use different stuff to track our cooldowns and buffs, so you will need to do some groundwork to find or make what works best for you. Here are some good starting points:

  - [Resto Druid Cursor combo](https://wago.io/cursorcombo) by Voulk which is regularly updated and easy to customise
  - [Resto Druid category](https://wago.io/the-war-within-weakauras/classes/druid/restoration) on Wago.io, where you can also find popular Addon profiles
  - If you see someone playing with a WeakAura you like but cannot find on your own, consider asking directly for the link or import code, like in their stream chat or comment section

Any useful WeakAuras that are specific to current Resto Druid play will be linked here:

  - [Double lifebloom group](https://wago.io/CtwLL5u0O/) for tracking Undergrowth by Doubt


# Dreamgrove Discord Server

Join the [Dreamgrove](https://discord.gg/dreamgrove) Discord server to stay up-to-date on the latest news and strategies, and to ask questions and share your own experiences about Resto Druid. 

Regular posters include the authors of our official guides, notable contributors to our class knowledge, and a handful of notable Resto Druid players in the Raid and M+ scenes. You can learn a lot just by lurking.

If you have any questions or comments regarding this page, you can ping me there.

## How to get good advice in #resto

No matter the time of day, there is always someone knowledgeable ready to help in #resto. Here's what you can do to make sure they can give you the best advice possible:

  - Best practice: Post a link to a [Log](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/how-to-use-warcraft-logs-6341). If you haven't uploaded any Logs yourself, you should still search your character name on Warcraft Logs to see if anyone has logged any content with you.
  - Second best practice: Post a screenshot of your Healing and/or Damage breakdown from your [Details! Damage Meter](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/details).
  - If you don't have any evidence of your performance to share, you can still try to describe how you play to receive some feedback. But if you are serious about improving, you should be prepared to look into the above tools.
