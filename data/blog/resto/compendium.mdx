This page should serve as a hub and an explainer for the best guides and resources available for Resto Druid Raid and M+ gameplay.

# Major Guides

Our official guides are all complementary, so you should read them all.

- **[Wowhead](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/classes/druid/restoration/overview-pve-healer)**: Resto Druid pages on Wowhead are written and kept up-to-date by Voulk. They will always include an overview of meta/starter talent builds, gear, rotations, and general gameplay tips. 

- **[Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/restoration-druid-pve-healing-guide)**: Resto Druid pages on Icy Veins are written and kept up-to-date by Torty. His write-ups build on foundational class knowledge and offer more in-depth explanations on optimising our kit for different content and scenarios.
  - [Current Raid tier (Amirdrassil) healing encounter guide](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/restoration-druid-pve-healing-amirdrassil-raid-guide)
  - [Resto Druid DPS in PvE content](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/restoration-druid-pve-dps-guide)

- **[Questionably Epic](https://questionablyepic.com/restodruid-sheet/)**: Resto Druid pages on Questionably Epic are written by Voulk. Our other guides above will basically always be kept more up-to-date than QE as its "simulation" side linked below is the higher priority.

# Resto Druid BiS Gear

All Wowhead and Icy Veins class guides always have "BiS" lists, but we only want to use them to get an idea of what pieces we will find valuable. As Resto Druids, we use the below tools to determine what gear to equip and where we might find upgrades.

# "Simming" Resto Druid

It's not actually simming, but it's the closest we've got. Your [SimC](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/simulationcraft) output can be used on the following websites:

## Questionably Epic Live

**[Questionably Epic Live](https://questionablyepic.com/live/)** (QELive): QELive was created by Voulk and is our resource that is always kept most up-to-date. Select the Dungeon or Raid setting at the top of the page, and use the Top Gear module to find your best set of gear based on everything you own and put into it. Top Gear supports set bonuses, stat diminishing returns, special effects, Great Vault exclusivity, and more.

### QELive basics
  - Always use Top Gear, not Quick Compare
  - Dungeon setting can be further configured to "Healing focused" or "Balanced" mode
  - Insert a Raid log using the button in the top right for increased accuracy

### QELive notable pages
  - [Trinkets graph](https://questionablyepic.com/live/trinkets) with Optional Settings for individual vs. group benefit, etc.
  - [Upgrade finder](https://questionablyepic.com/live/upgradeFinder) with filters for content types and difficulty levels
  - Voulk's [tutorial](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/how-to-use-qe-live-tool-guide) on all of QELive's tools

## Raidbots

**[Raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/)**: Raidbots is the default resource for simulating Resto Druid damage, particularly for use in M+.

# Other Resources

## WoWAnalyzer

Resto Druids can use [WoWAnalyzer](https://wowanalyzer.com/) to receive general feedback on logs. Our modules are maintained by Sref.

## Addons

Many Resto Druids find third-party Raid and Party frames to be more useful than Blizzard's stock UI for tracking our many HoTs. Popular frame Addons include Grid2, ElvUI, VuhDo, and Cell. We all use different stuff and don't endorse any one singular profile, so you will need to do some groundwork to find the config that works best for you.

  - [Wowhead](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/classes/druid/restoration/best-weakauras-macros-addons) page for Resto Druid UI resources
  - [Questionably Epic](https://questionablyepic.com/restodruid-interface/) page for Resto Druid UI resources

## WeakAuras

Again, we all use different stuff, so you will need to do some groundwork to find or make what works best for you. Here are some general WeakAuras that are regularly kept up-to-date that you might find useful:
