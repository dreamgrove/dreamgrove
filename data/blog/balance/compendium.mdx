## Tier Set

#### !393632|2-piece!


>!Starsurge! and !Starfall! increase the damage of your next !Wrath! or !Starfire! by 50%, stacking up to 3 times

This is roughly a 6.2% DPS increase from having no tier.

You can treat this buff either as a passive or try stacking it to 3 before using a generator, as per usual pooling for movement and getting starlord up has higher prio.

#### !394414|4-piece!

>When you enter !Eclipse!, your next !Starsurge! or !Starfall! cost 30 less Astral Power and deals 60% increased damage.

This is roughly a 7.8% DPS increase from having no tier.

The buff gives you a reduced cost on your next spender every time you enter !Eclipse!. Buff is also applied when activating !393960|Pulsar! or pressing !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation!

Total DPS from set: ~14.5%

- On 1-3 targets inside !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! cast !Wrath!
- On 4 or more targets inside !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! cast !Starfire!.

## How to Use Warrior of Elune

!Warrior of Elune! is an off-gcd ability, making your next 3 !Starfire! instant for 25 seconds. The ability has a 45s cooldown that starts once you've pressed it.

!Warrior of Elune! can be used 7 seconds before an eclipse ends, this way you will have just enough time to spend your third charge before the buff runs out and the CD will start earlier, which can net you more uses throughout the fight.

Use the charges to enter Solar Eclipse or as a movement GCD in !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! /Lunar Eclipse. Using a Warrior of Elune Starfire in single target during !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! is NOT a damage increase if you do not need to move.

If Warrior of Elune is falling off during !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! and you still have a charge to spend, you can !Starfire! at 2+ targets.

Warrior of Elune can also be used during !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! /Lunar Eclipse when there are adds up, this will net you a lot of Astral Power which can be useful to target down a specific add or to provide more boss damage by utilizing the AP on Starsurges.

## How to use Owlkin Frenzy procs

Use !Owlkin Frenzy! procs to enter Solar Eclipse, inside Lunar Eclipse or inside !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! if Starfire will hit 3 or more targets.

Keep in mind that !Warrior of Elune! charges are consumed before !Owlkin Frenzy! procs.

# Talents
## Raid

<Talents name={"Single Target"} talents={"BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgCAJJigkQQSikIFolIJSSJRTcgQol0SSERDgCAE"}/>

## Mythic+

The following are dungeon talent builds that will always serve you well but mind that there can be some variations based on your group comp or affixes. !New Moon! and !Fury of Elune! can be used interchangeably.

<Talents name={"Balanced build"} talents={"BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgCAJJigkQQSikcgUgWiDkkkUSCJJgm0iEJ0AoAAB"}/>
<Talents name={"Weaver build"} talents={"BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgCAJJigkQQSikcgUgWiDkkkUSCJJgm0iEJUAoAAB"}/>

!New Moon! provides more single target damage and is easy to pair with pulsar.
!202770|FoE! does slightly more AoE but is more difficult to align with !393960|Pulsar!, making it annoying to play.

The below picture showcases which talents are "mandatory" and which talents you can opt-in to:

![Mythic](/static/images/talent-tree-mythic+.png)

**Secondary builds:**

[Class tree with Hibernate for Incorporeal](https://raidbots.com/simbot/render/talents/BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgCAJJJCSCBJJSiUgWiDkkkUSCJHIEaSJCJRDgCAE?bgcolor=000000)

[If you really need both Hibernate and Remove Corruption](https://raidbots.com/simbot/render/talents/BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgCQkkkISSAkESiUgWiDkkkUSCJHIEaSJCJRDgCAE?bgcolor=000000)

- !Ursine Vigor!, !Well-Honed Instincts! and !Improved Stampeding Roar! are the major competing talents. !Ursine Vigor! should be taken if you need it to survive certain abilities. !Well-Honed Instincts! is always on 1 point but a 2nd can be taken if you rarely/never use Bear Form. spell 288826 "Improved Stampeding Roar">}} is extremely useful in indoor dungeons and in spiteful weeks.
- !Remove Corruption! should be taken in Afflicted weeks.
- !Cyclone! has basically no use other than stopping Bursting and can be replaced with anything else(which also won't have any use).
- !Hibernate! can be used for the Incorporeal affix.
- For lower keys, you can put 1 point into !Feline Swiftness! like [this](https://raidbots.com/simbot/render/talents/BYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgCAJiIIJSQSikIFHgWiDEJJlkQSChmUiEJRDgCAE?bgcolor=000000). This skips !Ursine Vigor! and !Typhoon!. You can also drop any of the other bottom talents you don't need to get a 2nd point in !Feline Swiftness! to get around even quicker for farming keys.
- All other talents in the druid tree are more or less set.

# Consumables
## Potions

[Potion of Ultimate Power](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191383/elemental-potion-of-ultimate-power)

Use this for every situation. Potion of Elemental Power is only minorly worse if you want to save gold.

## Food

- [Grand Banquet of the Kaluak](https://www.wowhead.com/item=197794/grand-banquet-of-the-kaluak): Intellect buff
- [Deviously Deviled Eggs](https://www.wowhead.com/item=204072/deviously-deviled-eggs): Same buff as Banquet but with a cheaper individual price.
- [Sizzling Seafood Medley](https://www.wowhead.com/item=197784/sizzling-seafood-medley): Provides Haste + Mastery which can be more dps than the Intellect food.
- [Thousandbone Tongueslicer](https://www.wowhead.com/item=197786/thousandbone-tongueslicer): Provides Crit + Mastery which can be more dps than the Intellect food.

The secondary food can be better as you acquire more gear, they provide more total stats than the main stat one. Sim your character to see what is best for you.

## Phials

**ST & AoE**

Damage wise, with 100% uptime on all of the Phials and not counting in the downsides their hierarchy is as follows on ST:

- [Phial of Corrupting Rage](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191329/iced-phial-of-corrupting-rage): Default phial unless the fight has too high damage intake or you are at risk of dying. Do not use this in progress fights unless you really need the damage.
- [Phial of Tepid Versatility](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191341/phial-of-tepid-versatility): Has the same value as Corrupting Rage at 60% uptime. Can be worth to play if the damage intake is high.
- [Phial of Elemental Chaos](https://www.wowhead.com/item=191359/phial-of-elemental-chaos): Generally similar dps throughput as Tepid Versatility, but less defensive benefits.

## Runes

Our main rune is [Hissing Rune](https://www.wowhead.com/item=204973/hissing-rune)
In some cases either [Howling Rune](https://www.wowhead.com/item=194820/howling-rune) or [Buzzing Rune](https://www.wowhead.com/item=194823/buzzing-rune) might sim slightly better.

# Gearing
## Stat Priority

Sim yourself using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). **Do not follow any stat priorities.**

## Enchants

- Weapon - [Sophic Devotion](https://www.wowhead.com/item=200054/enchant-weapon-sophic-devotion?crafting-quality=6)/[Wafting Devotion](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=200058/enchant-weapon-wafting-devotion)
Sim between these two options to determine which one is best for your character.

- Chest - [Waking Stats](https://www.wowhead.com/item=200030/enchant-chest-waking-stats?crafting-quality=6) Intellect
- Cloak - [Graceful Avoidance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=200031/enchant-cloak-graceful-avoidance) Avoidance + Reduced fall damage
- Legs - [Lambent Armor Kit](https://www.wowhead.com/item=204702/lambent-armor-kit?crafting-quality=6)/[Frozen Spellthread](https://www.wowhead.com/item=194013/frozen-spellthread?crafting-quality=6)
  - Sim between these two options to determine which one is best for your character.
- Wrist - [Devotion of Avoidance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=200021/enchant-bracer-devotion-of-avoidance?crafting-quality=6) Avoidance
- Boots - [Watchers Loam](https://www.wowhead.com/item=200020/enchant-boots-watchers-loam) Stamina
- Ring - [Devotion of Mastery](https://www.wowhead.com/item=200039/enchant-ring-devotion-of-mastery?crafting-quality=6) You should always sim your own character to determine what enchant to use in this slot.

## Gems

Use [Skillfull Illimited Diamond](https://www.wowhead.com/item=192988/skillful-illimited-diamond) as your Primalist Gem. For normal gems refer to [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear)

## Embellishments
### For embellishments there are a couple of options this season:

- [Toxic Thorn Footwraps](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193452/toxic-thorn-footwraps) with [Toxified Armor Patch](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193555/toxified-armor-patch).
  - Provides great single target damage and has an early spike since only the boots needs to be crafted at 525 for the effect to scale to that itemlevel.
  - Locks you in to boots as your crafted items with predfefined stats.
- [Shadowflame Tempered Armor Patch](https://www.wowhead.com/item=204710/shadowflame-tempered-armor-patch)
  - Good single target damage.
  - Deals a small amount of self-damage.
  - Can be added to any crafted leather slot.
- [Verdant Conduit](https://www.wowhead.com/item=208189/verdant-conduit)
  - Performs slightly worse in single target.
  - Performs well in aoe.
  - Can be added to any crafted leather slot.
- [Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193001/elemental-lariat)
  - Requires a lot of gems.
  - Performs well in AoE and Single Target.
  - Locks you in to a crafted neck but you can choose the stats on it freely.
- [Blue Silken Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193946/blue-silken-lining)
  - Performs the best of all embellishments both in AoE and Single Target.
  - Requires you to be above 90% health for it to be active.
  - Can be applied on any crafted item.

### Which embellishments should you choose?

This is entirely up to you, below are some guidelines to make your choice more informed.

- [Blue Silken Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193946/blue-silken-lining) provides the most amount of DPS given that you have the uptime for it(usually more than 40%). Can be swapped at any point by recrafting and adding/removing the embellishment.
- [Toxic Thorn Footwraps](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193452/toxic-thorn-footwraps) is a single target focused embellishment with an early power spike. Locks yourself with crafted boots with predfefined stats.
- [Shadowflame Tempered Armor Patch](https://www.wowhead.com/item=204710/shadowflame-tempered-armor-patch) and [Verdant Conduit](https://www.wowhead.com/item=208189/verdant-conduit) are good for the flexibility, you can change these around at any point depending on what fits the content you're doing.
- [Elemental Lariat](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193001/elemental-lariat) performs well in both Single Target and AoE, but requires a lot of gems and locks yourself with a crafted neck as the embellishment can't be removed from it.

### What slot should i craft in?

This will depend on your current gear situtation, below are some guidelines:

- Bracers are often used as they have the lowest stat budget and can have a socket. This will be good later on when your other pieces can be upgraded to 525 itemlevel.
- Cloaks are another slot with the lowest stat budget, but they can't be socketed.
- Belts have a higher stat budget, but they can have a socket.
- A Ring, if you've chosen to craft [Blue Silken Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193946/blue-silken-lining), is another good slot. It also comes with a socket.


## Trinkets

[Umbreiskul's Fractured Heart](https://www.wowhead.com/item=193639/umbrelskuls-fractured-heart) is simming better than a lot of other options at lower ilvl. It may be worth getting this trinket early on in the season, but it loses value on higher ilvls. 

Doing [Dawn of the Infinite](https://www.wowhead.com/zone=14514/dawn-of-the-infinite) on hard mode without your group dying can reward you with a [Mirror of Fractured Tomorrows](https://www.wowhead.com/item=207581/mirror-of-fractured-tomorrows) at myth track, making it possible to upgrade it to 528. This makes the trinket perform very good in both ST and AoE and should be your ideal on-use trinket if you manage to get your hands on it.

[Vessel of Searing Shadow](https://www.wowhead.com/item=202615/vessel-of-searing-shadow) is simming very good when paired with [Seal of Diurna's Chosen ](https://www.wowhead.com/item=195480/seal-of-diurnas-chosen) for ST. These items are not that good seperately, but together they are outperforming other options by around 0.5%

Please use Top Gear or Droptimizer on [Raidbots](https://raidbots.com) in order to decide what trinkets to use/farm, but the following list should give you a good idea of some of the trinkets you will want to look out for. The list is in roughly power-level order assuming the highest item level versions of the trinkets.

## FAQ

### I've read the priority list and I think my rotation looks correct but I'm still doing very low damage. What could be the reason?

Log one of your fights and check it with [warcraftlogs](https://articles.warcraftlogs.com/help/how-to-navigate-through-logs) and [wowanalyzer](https://wowanalyzer.com/). The main thing to check is if you're always casting: the timeline should have no downtime and, as close to zero as possible, cancelled casts. Another common issue is incorrectly planning your movement and wasting casts on dots: you should always have enough AP to cover some distance just by using spenders.

### How do I sim for AoE?

Balance Druid's gear mostly doesn't change from ST to AoE so simming "5m 1t patchwerk" is usually fine even for AoE situations. Other sims like "5t 40s" are unrealistic scenarios that will provide skewed and wrong sims in most cases and hence shouldn't be used. If you want to do an accurate M+ sim consider using the [MDT Sim WeakAura](https://wago.io/Yya4XBbl-) and remember that ST fights are still a big part of Mythic+.

### I'm doing really low damage in Mythic+, what am I doing wrong?

If you double-checked your rotation and still feel like you're underperforming you could just be playing low keys, together with classes that have very bursty damage profiles. When playing a Balance Druid, mobs need to live long enough for you to actually start doing damage, which is something that doesn't really happen in keys lower than 20+ and especially on Tyrannical. Consider focusing a bit more on ST or trying another spec, but take into account the fact that DPS isn't everything in a key.

### I've seen a lot of people running build X instead of Y in Mythic+, is X better?

This season there are many viable builds and in the end, once the necessary talents are taken, it just comes down to personal preference. One notable example is the choice between !Fury of Elune! and !New Moon!: the former performs slightly better in AoE scenarios, while the latter is slightly better in ST, so people will usually pick the one they're most comfortable with. Feel free to use any of the builds mentioned in the Talents section.

### How do I track our tierset?

You can use the [following WeakAura](https://wago.io/BoomkinTierSet)

### How can I proc !Waning Twilight! without mushrooms or flare?

With !Astral Smolder!

### Why are some top players running different embellishments from the ones mentioned in the Compendium

The DPS gain provided by the embellishments can vary significantly because of many external factors such as gear, type of content and group composition. Some of the top players might also happen to use niche embellishments for the same reasons. If you don't have any specific requirements then your best option is to just sim your character and choose the embellishments that provide the highest DPS upgrade.

### Do our dots snapshot?

No, all of our periodic damage (like !Moonfire!, !Sunfire!, !Stellar Flare!) do NOT snapshot, everything is dynamic. That means any dots gain/lose the damage bonus upon entering/leaving the Eclipse that buffs them and whenever any other stat/damage increases are applied/expire.

### What is Astral damage?

Astral damage is both Arcane and Nature damage. Effects that buff Nature spells also applies to Astral spells, and effects that buff Arcane spells likewise also applies to Astral spells. For example, Solar Eclipse multiplies the damage of all Nature & Astral spells by 1.15x, and Lunar Eclipse multiplies the damage of all Arcane & Astral spells by 1.15x. If you have both eclipses, Astral spells get 1.15 \* 1.15 = 1.3225x multiplier, while Nature & Arcane spells get 1.15x.

Mind that class buffs only affect class spells so if a trinket does nature or arcane damage they are not affected by our buffs to these spell schools.

# Additional Resources
## Macros

**Orbital Strike macro:**

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@cursor] Celestial Alignment
```

**Trinket macro:**

If you are using an on-use trinket that should go along with your cooldowns, use the following macro (/13 for top trinket slot, and /14 for bottom trinket slot)

```
#showtooltip
/use 13
/use 14
/cast [@cursor] Celestial Alignment
```

## Cancelaura Macros

### **Cancelling Pulsar**

**As of 10.1.5 and forward this no longer represents a relevant gain with the change to Radiant Moonlight increasing the cooldown of Fury of Elune by 5 seconds.**

### **Cancelling Starlord**

**With baseline changes and new set in 10.2, cancelling your Starlord aura is back to being insignificant (~0.2%)**

If you want to engage in this entirely optional method without incurring a dps loss, you should aim to cancel Starlord at any point in an Eclipse window where the buff is currently at less than two seconds, and you are about to use !Starsurge! to prevent overcapping.

```
#showtooltip
/cancelaura Starlord
```

## Useful WeakAura(s)

### **Balance WeakAura Packs**

The following links lead to various balance druid WeakAura packs. These contain everything that's recommended to track to play at a high level. None of these are particular better or more useful than others, and which one you should use is up to your personal preference.

- [Shrom's Ultimate AP Bar](https://wago.io/GzpP7i8ic)
- [Genesis DF Balance Druid](https://wago.io/1HX3XwarK)
- [Oi Balance pack](https://wago.io/OiBalance)

### **Casts until you can cast Starfire**

[Starfire Alerter](https://wago.io/rrtAyRQjF):
See the description of the WA for more details. This is not a required WA but will make it easier to not get into situations where you are wasting a Starfire cast inside Solar Eclipse.
