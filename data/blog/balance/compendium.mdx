## 25th of March tuning notes
> [!NOTE]
> !Wrath! damage increased by 30%.
>
> !Starsurge! damage increased by 5%.
>
> Elune’s Chosen: !Lunar Calling! increases !Starfire!’s damage to its primary target by 160% (was 100%).

This is around a 7% buff on ST for both hero talents. The buff to !Wrath! has resulted in some talent changes for ST and builds in the talent section has been updated. This buff also changes some stuff regarding target count conditions for when to enter Solar Eclipse, so the Eclipses & Fillers section has been changed.

## Raid Guide 

Dreamgrove has a [raid guide](https://www.dreamgrove.gg/raids/liberation_of_undermine?roles=Balance) page that is a community curated resource that anybody can submit contributions to. It should include different talent builds for each boss, general tips for how to handle some mechanics and/or links to kill videos or relevant VODs.

## Tier set

#### [2-piece](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1215695/druid-balance-11-1-class-set-2pc)

>Your damaging spells have a chance to hit a Jackpot, growing a !Wild Mushroom! at a nearby enemy's location at 100% effectiveness. Casting !194223|CA!/!102560|Inc! always hits a Jackpot.

This is approximately ~6% dmg increase from having no set.

#### [4-piece](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1215698/druid-balance-11-1-class-set-4pc)

>!Starfall! and !Starsurge! damage against targets affected by your !Wild Mushroom!'s damage over time effect is increased by 20%.

This is approximately ~11% dmg increase from having no set.

## Current Bugs

- !Control of the Dream! does not give the proper CDR on the first use of the affecting spells if you wipe to a boss. You need to change talents in the choice node to fix it. You can use [this weakaura](https://wago.io/ControlBug) to change the choice node around by pressing a button in the middle of your screen.

- Changing talents from !Orbital Strike! to !Whirling Stars! can make macros using !194223|CA!/!102560|Inc! not work at all, giving you an error message and have your button be desaturated on your bars. This requires a relog to fix.

- If you spell-queue a free spender through a !Starweaver! or !Touch the Cosmos! proc as your first global in an !Eclipse!, you will gain no value from !Hail of Stars!.

<Checkbox isIcon id="EC Fillers" spellId={202770} name="Elune's Chosen" radio="Fillers" />

- [*Keeper Fillers] Enter !Solar Eclipse! and cast !Wrath! on 1 and 2 targets.
- [*Keeper Fillers] If you enter !Lunar Eclipse! by mistake on 1 target, cast !Wrath!.
- [*Keeper Fillers] If talented into !114107|Soul of the Forest! and !Umbral Intensity!, enter !Lunar Eclipse! on 3 targets. Otherwise, enter !Solar Eclipse! and cast !Wrath!.
- [*Keeper Fillers] Enter !Lunar Eclipse! on 4+ targets.
- [*Keeper Fillers] Cast !Wrath! in !194223|CA!/!102560|Inc! on 1 and 2 targets. 
- [*Keeper Fillers] Cast !Starfire! in !194223|CA!/!102560|Inc! on 3+ targets.
- [*EC Fillers] If talented into !Lunar Calling!, enter !Lunar Eclipse! and use !Starfire! on all target counts.
- Use !Starsurge! on 1 target.
- Use !Starfall! on 2+ targets.


<Collapsible title="How to Use Warrior of Elune">

!Warrior of Elune! is an off-gcd ability, making your next 3 !Starfire! instant for 25 seconds. The ability has a 45s cooldown that starts once you've pressed it.

If you are playing !Lunar Calling! you should use your !Warrior of Elune! charges when you have no stacks of !Nature's Grace!.

When not talented into Lunar Calling, use !Warrior of Elune! with 7 seconds remaining on !Eclipse! and use the charges to enter Solar Eclipse. 
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="How to Use Owlkin Frenzy">
Use !Owlkin Frenzy! procs to enter Solar Eclipse, inside Lunar Eclipse or inside !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! if Starfire will hit 2 or more targets. Keep in mind that !Warrior of Elune! charges are consumed before !Owlkin Frenzy! procs.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="How to Use Whirling Stars">
!Whirling Stars! is a talent that changes your !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! cooldown to a charge system, with a 100s recharge. In Keeper of the Grove, you want to overlap these charges with !248280|Force of Nature! and !Convoke the Spirits! or just !248280|Force of Nature! if your !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! will recharge before !391528|Convoke! comes back off cooldown. 

In a raid scenario where you pull a boss with both charges up, you want to use your 1st charge on pull, and your 2nd charge together with your 2nd or 3rd set of !248280|Force of Nature! treants, and save your 3rd charge for !391528|Convoke! at 2 minutes. After this, you just aim to overlap all 3 cooldowns with the priority outlined in rotation section.

In an M+ scenario, if you're talented into !Incarnation: Chosen of Elune! instead of !391528|Convoke!, you want to use your !Whirling Stars! charges at any time where you can overlap with !248280|Force of Nature!.

When using !Elune's Chosen! and not talented into !391528|Convoke!, you can use !Whirling Stars! right after entering an !Eclipse! that procs !Sundered Firmament!, but this is not a major gain. If you're using !Elune's Chosen! and you're talented into !391528|Convoke!, you want to overlap your !Whirling Stars! charge with your !391528|Convoke! cooldown.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="How to Use Nature's Grace">

When using !Nature's Grace! you should make sure to start casting your !Wrath!/!Starfire! when the duration of your active !Eclipse! is shorter than the cast time of your !Wrath!/!Starfire!. This will make sure that you always keep 1 stack of !Nature's Grace! when entering your new !Eclipse!. This can be tricky to pull off consistently when cycling between !Lunar Eclipse!. Try to bank some AP for the end of !Eclipse! if you need to fill a GCD to time your !Wrath! cast correctly.

If you are approaching a pack in mythic+ you can cancelaura your !Nature's Grace! and spell-queue 2 !Wrath! casts while the tank is walking towards the pack before you've entered combat, this will make it so you are in !Lunar Eclipse! and have 2 stacks of !Nature's Grace! up for faster !Starfire! casts whenever you've finished spreading your dots. This can be tricky to pull off, especially if your tank is chaining a lot of packs. The moment you enter combat, you should always start spreading !Moonfire! and !Sunfire! before entering !Eclipse!.

You can use the macro below and replace your existing !Wrath! keybind with it to cancel !Nature's Grace! when you're out of combat to help with this.

The following are dungeon talent builds that will always serve you well but mind that there can be some variations based on your group comp or affixes. Do not be afraid of swapping some talents out if you think it can help your group. 

Both hero trees are viable and perform very close to each other. Feel free to choose the one you prefer.

## Talent Explanations

The Druid class tree has received a rework for 11.1 with better pathing and more freedom to take useful talents. Below, you will find a graphic outlining what talents are mandatory and what talents are optional for each section of the tree, together with explanations for the options you have.

![ClassTree](/static/images/classtreebalance%2B.png)

<Checkbox isIcon id="Keeper Image" spellId={205636} name="Keeper" defaultCheck radio="image"/>

[*Keeper Image] ![KeeperTalents](/static/images/talentboxkotg.png)

[*EC Image]
![ECTalents](/static/images/talentboxec.png)

<Collapsible title="Class Tree Talents">
### Top Section Explained
- After taking the mandatory defensive and offensive nodes in the top section of the tree, you are required to spend 1 more point before you can progress down the tree. 

  !Remove Corruption! and !Killer Instinct! are your options here. !Remove Corruption! is a poison/curse dispel, and is the preferred choice in most Mythic+ content, but does not offer a lot of value in raid. !Killer Instinct! increases your armor and physical damage done, which can give you a very minor damage increase if you are using !Convoke the Spirits! in melee range. 

  !Hibernate! is a viable option for pathing, but the spell has no real value in any current content.

### Middle Section Explained
- In the middle of the tree, you have noticeably more options to choose from. After choosing the mandatory talents in this section, there are 4 points to spend before you can progress further down the tree.

  Either !Feline Swiftness! and !Well-Honed Instincts! are necessary to progress down the left side of the tree. !Feline Swiftness! is a good movement speed talent, while !Well-Honed Instincts! gives a minor defensive every 90-120 seconds, depending on the talent below it. It is beneficial to take both options in reasonable content.

  Either one of !Typhoon! or the !Ursol's Vortex! node are needed to progress down the right side of the tree. They are both situational utilities you can use dependent on what content you're doing. You are likely to use both in Mythic+.

  !Matted Fur! is a very minor defensive talent that gives you a small shield when you press !Barkskin!.

  [Light of the Sun](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=202918/light-of-the-sun) reduces the cooldown of your !Solar Beam! by 15 seconds, making your interrupt have a 45 second cooldown instead of a 60 second cooldown. 

  !Astral Influence! increases the range of your spells by 5 yards. Good talent to take if you're in a situation where you need to outrange an ability. Good point to spend if you have no better options available.

### Bottom Section Explained
- After choosing the mandatory talents in this section of the tree, you're left with 4 more points to spend on optional talents.

  !Improved Stampeding Roar! is an often relied-upon option for progression fights where your raid can benefit from a group-wide movement speed increase. Talk to your raid leader and make the decision that's best for your group.

  !Nature's Vigil! is a situationally helpful talent for your raid. Talk to your raid leader and healer team and make a decision that's best for your progression when considering this talent. 

  !Forestwalk! is a situationally good node, giving you increased movement speed and healing received after casting !Regrowth!. This can be strong when paired with !Blooming Infusion! and !Protective Growth! for fights that require good defensive value.

  !Incapacitating Roar! is a good option to make use of in Mythic+.

  !Ursine Vigor! is a solid defensive node that increases your health and armor by 15% for the first 4 seconds of entering !Bear Form!. This talent is a solid choice in general. 

</Collapsible>
<Collapsible title="Spec Tree ">

- For the Balance Druid spec tree there are currently a solid number of talent iterations to choose from that don't provide a meaningful increase to your damage. Talents like !114107|Soul of the Forest!, !Crashing Star!, !Touch the Cosmos!, !Hail of Stars!, !Umbral Inspiration! and !Sundered Firmament! are mostly interchangeable in ST with Keeper of the Grove, which is the recommended hero talent for raid encounters. Below there will be short explanations for each talent. Keep in mind that most of these options don't provide any changes in your rotation or decision making.

### Top Section

- !Stellar Flare! is currently simming noticeably worse than !Wild Surges! on ST and is generally untakeable outside of niche situations where you can maintain dots on targets that are far apart, like if you stand in the middle on [Cauldron of Carnage](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/the-war-within/raids/liberation-of-undermine/cauldron-of-carnage-boss-strategy) or on [One-Armed Bandit](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/the-war-within/raids/liberation-of-undermine/one-armed-bandit-boss-strategy). !Wild Surges! is the recommended choice for most content outside of the niche scenarios where !Stellar Flare! can be useful.
  
  !Nature's Balance! sims around 0.6% higher than !Twin Moons! on pure single target, but loses out whenever there are more targets, where you can benefit from !Twin Moons! spreading !Moonfire!.
  
  !Aetherial Kindling! is a preferred choice for any sustained AoE scenario where you can benefit from your DoT effects being extended. Very good for m+.

### Middle Section

- !Sunseeker Mushroom! or !Wild Mushroom! are mandatory talents since they help saturate the [4-piece](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1215698/druid-balance-11-1-class-set-4pc) uptime. !Sunseeker Mushroom! is by far the preferred option as the active !Wild Mushroom! ability does not do a lot of damage by itself and !Sunseeker Mushroom! is more than enough paired with the [2-piece](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1215695/druid-balance-11-1-class-set-2pc) to get decent enough uptime.
  
  !Stellar Amplification! is recommended for ST scenarios where you cast Starsurge enough to keep good uptime on it, taken for most raid encounters.
  
  !Touch the Cosmos! got a buff since 11.0 and is picked in most ST iterations. You can drop this talent for !Umbral Inspiration!. In M+ with !Elune's Chosen! your choice will generally be between !Touch the Cosmos! or !Umbral Inspiration! and the choice does not make a big difference. !Umbral Inspiration! is better on AoE, while !Touch the Cosmos! provides some needed movement globals.
  
  !Umbral Intensity! is a very good talent for both !Keeper of the Grove! and !Elune's Chosen!. The best build on ST that isn't taking !Umbral Intensity! is around 1% behind on ST.
  
  !Astronomical Impact! is a decent talent for both ST and AoE, but requires you to route through !Umbral Intensity! to reach it.
  
  !114107|Soul of the Forest! in itself is an okay talent in ST and the extra Astral Power generation can help you in dealing with spots in raid where there is a lot of movement. It is mandatory in AoE.
  
  !Crashing Star! is an optional talent in ST, and is good when paired with !114107|Soul of the Forest!.
  
  !Hail of Stars! is an optional talent in general for ST, but loses out on AoE because of diminishing returns on !Shooting Stars! when there are more targets.

### Bottom Section

- !Power of Goldrinn! got a buff heading into 11.1 and is recommended for all ST encounters.
  
  !Umbral Inspiration! can be swapped out on ST for another talent, but is generally recommended for all content.
  
  !Sundered Firmament! is optional for !Keeper of the Grove!, but mandatory for !Elune's Chosen! since it helps provide uptime for !Atmospheric Exposure!. 
  
  !Orbit Breaker! is good whenever paired with !Hail of Stars!, as the increased duration on !Solstice! helps saturate !Orbit Breaker! procs. 

  !Sundered Firmament! and !Orbit Breaker! both benefit from the damage increase from !Radiant Moonlight!.
  
  !Denizen of the Dream! is a strong single target node, but loses value in AoE scenarios. Recommended for all raid fights.

  !Fury of Elune! and !Radiant Moonlight! are both mandatory talents for !Elune's Chosen!, but are generally not picked for !Keeper of the Grove!. You can pick !Fury of Elune! in !Keeper of the Grove! if you can consistently line up the cooldown with add spawns.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Convoke the Spirits vs Incarnation: Chosen of Elune">
!Keeper of the Grove! compliments !391528|Convoke! pretty well when you use it with the dmg increase from !Harmony of the Grove! and !Celestial Alignment!. !391528|Convoke! is also good for priority damage and boss fights in M+. !Incarnation: Chosen of Elune! is good for AoE scenarios, or in situations where !391528|Convoke! would use spells on targets you don't want to hit.  !Incarnation: Chosen of Elune! also pairs well with !Whirling Stars! in M+, giving you very consistent cooldowns on most packs, and allows for more flexibility in when your damage spikes, as opposed to !391528|Convoke!. If you're playing !391528|Convoke! in M+, you should use it in AoE with the conditions outlined in the "Rotation" section.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Control of the Dream vs. Power of the Dream">
!Control of the Dream! lets you hold on to either !194223|Celestial Alignment!/!102560|Incarnation!, !391528|Convoke! or !205636|Force of Nature! for up to 15 seconds without losing a use, subtracting the amount of time you held the ability from its cooldown.

Depending on the fight timer, this talent is stronger than !Power of the Dream! which it shares a choice node with. As always, you should research the fight you are preparing for on [warcraftlogs](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/) or sim your character to make an educated guess.

## Embellishments & Crafted Items

Embellishments for this season don't offer a substantial gain, so it's important that you always sim your character using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear) before making any gearing decision, but here are some guidelines:

[Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024/darkmoon-sigil-ascension) and [Writhing Armor Banding](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506/writhing-armor-banding)

This is a solid all-round choice for both single target and AoE. The [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222561/darkmoon-sigil-ascension) can be crafted on any weapon. If you go this route, you should aim to craft this on a two-handed weapon early, and craft the [Writhing Armor Banding](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506/writhing-armor-banding) on a low stat budget slot, preferably on the cloak, belt or wrist slot. Keep in mind that this embellishment only stacks during combat, making it a lot less valuable in mythic+. This option is generally worse later in the season when you can get either of the weapons with special effects. 

---

[Elemental Focusing Lens](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213770/elemental-focusing-lens)

This is a solid all-round choice for single target and mythic+. It's a random damage proc effect, where the type of damage is determined based on what kind of gems you are wearing. Equipping more gems or changing the type does not matter for the damage output. If you go for this choice, you should aim to craft two of them on low stat budget slots, notably the cloak, belt or wrist slots.

---

[Duskthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222873/duskthread-lining) or [Dawnthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222869/dawnthread-lining)

These are buffs that give you versatility or critical strike when you're above 80% hp. They are decent choices for mythic+, depending on the uptime you can get. They're similiar to the Blue Silken Lining embellishment from Dragonflight. If you go for this choice, you should aim to craft them on two low stat budget slots, notably the cloak, wrist or belt slots.

[Roiling Thunderstrike Talons](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219513/roiling-thunderstrike-talons) and [Rook Feather Wristwraps](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219511/rook-feather-wristwraps)

These are part of a set that has a chance to drop an orb close to your target, granting a haste buff for 12 seconds. This is simming closely to other options, but can be frustrating to play and is generally not recommended.

## Trinkets

> [!WARNING]
> Remember to always sim your character using [Top Gear on Raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). The following list is made assuming the highest ilvl version of these trinkets.

|  | [Entropic Skardyn Core](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219296/entropic-skardyn-core?bonus=4795&ilvl=678&spec=102) | Spawns an orb you need to pick up for a primary stat buff. |

## Weapons

> [!NOTE]
> Season 2 offers some weapons with special effects. Generally, a 675 crafted staff performs better than heroic version of these weapons. These weapons share cooldown with trinkets, so you are not able to overlap them. You should aim to line up these weapons with your cooldowns whenever possible, but don't delay their use effect for a prolonged period of time. Remember to always sim your character.

## Cyrce's Circlet

The [Cyrce's Circlet](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228411/cyrces-circlet) ring from 11.0.7 is still very good in season 2, beating out every other alternative at 678 even after the nerf to [Legendary Skipper's](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228646/legendary-skippers-citrine). The best gems for the ring are [Stormbringer's](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228638/stormbringers-runed-citrine), [Fathomdweller's](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228639/fathomdwellers-runed-citrine) and [Windsinger's](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228640/windsingers-runed-citrine).

# FAQ

### Q: Why can't I enter Solar Eclipse?

**A:** Because you are talented into !Lunar Calling!.

### Q: How can I proc !Waning Twilight! without !Wild Mushroom! or !Stellar Flare!?

**A:** With !Astral Smolder!.

### Q: I am talented into !Lycara's Teachings!, but the Mastery on my character panel is not showing right value, is it bugged?

**A:** The Mastery % displayed in your character panel shows the value of the !Astral Invocation! spell, which is the damage increased on targets affected by !Sunfire! and !Moonfire! and not the full effect of your Mastery.

### Q:What is Astral damage?

**A:** Astral damage is both Arcane and Nature damage. Effects that buff Nature spells also applies to Astral spells, and effects that buff Arcane spells likewise also applies to Astral spells. For example, Solar Eclipse multiplies the damage of all Nature & Astral spells by 1.15x, and Lunar Eclipse multiplies the damage of all Arcane & Astral spells by 1.15x. If you have both eclipses, Astral spells get 1.15 \* 1.15 = 1.3225x multiplier, while Nature & Arcane spells get 1.15x.

Keep in mind that class buffs only affect class spells so if a trinket does nature or arcane damage they are not affected by our buffs to these spell schools.

### Q: Do our dots snapshot?

**A:** No, all of our periodic damage (like !Moonfire!, !Sunfire!, !Stellar Flare!) do NOT snapshot, everything is dynamic. This means any dots gain/lose the damage bonus upon entering/leaving the Eclipse that buffs them and whenever any other stat/damage increases are applied/expire.

### Q: Is there a target count where spreading Sunfire or Moonfire is not worth it?

**A:** No, having your DoT effects up increases your damage done to the target. The conditions for spreading Sunfire and Moonfire are tied to how long the target will live, and not how many targets there are.

### Q: How do I sim for M+?

**A:** It is generally recommended that you steer away from simming unrealistic scenarios like "5 target 40 seconds" as they are likely to give skewed results. Balance Druid stats don't really change much depending on target count either, so you will be perfectly fine just using the default "1 target 5 minute patchwerk" options. If your intention is to sim for mythic+, you can use the [MDT Sim WeakAura](https://wago.io/Yya4XBbl-) which allows you to sim dungeon routes. Please keep in mind that ST damage is still a big part of mythic+.

### Q: I've seen a lot of people running build X instead of Y in Mythic+, is X better?

**A:** Try them out and make an informed decision! Most differences between builds are based on variables like target count, comps, combat timer or utility needed.

### Q: I'm doing really low damage in Mythic+, what am I doing wrong?

**A:**  If you double-checked your rotation and still feel like you're underperforming you could just be playing low keys, together with classes that have very bursty damage profiles. When playing a Balance Druid, mobs need to live long enough for you to actually start doing damage, which is something that doesn't really happen in keys lower than 12+. Consider focusing a bit more on ST or trying another spec, but take into account the fact that DPS isn't everything in a key.

### Q: I've read the priority list and I think my rotation looks correct but I'm still doing very low damage. What could be the reason?

**A:** Log one of your fights and check it with [warcraftlogs](https://articles.warcraftlogs.com/help/how-to-navigate-through-logs) and [wowanalyzer](https://wowanalyzer.com/). The main thing to check is if you're always casting: the timeline should have no downtime and, as close to zero as possible, cancelled casts. Another common issue is incorrectly planning your movement and wasting casts on dots: you should always have enough AP to cover some distance just by using spenders.

### Q: I have read through the Compendium and I have some questions that are not outlined in this FAQ?

**A:**  If you have any questions, you can go to the [Dreamgrove discord server](https://discord.gg/XaZ3uXJc) and then ask in there. This guide should cover everything you need, but there could always be some things left out or not considered. Remember, you are not guaranteed to receive the answer you would like.

## Balance Druid Video Guide

For 11.1, the Balance Compendium writer decided to make a video guide in addition to the written guide. Be aware that some things can change depending on tuning, like talents or trinkets, and you should always double check the written guide. You can find the video by opening the collapsible below.

## Useful WeakAuras and Other Profiles

### **Balance WeakAura Packs**

The following links lead to various Balance Druid WeakAura packs. These contain everything that's recommended to track to play at a high level. None of these are particular better or more useful than others, and which one you should use is up to your personal preference.

- [Oi Balance pack](https://wago.io/OiBalance)
- [Shrom's Ultimate AP Bar](https://wago.io/GzpP7i8ic)
- [LuckyOneUI Druid](https://wago.io/LuckyoneUI-Druid)
- [Afenar The War Within](https://wago.io/HkrSdHFMG)
- [Shrom's AP Bar - Standalone](https://wago.io/J5V9sTM0F)

### **Jundies Plater Profile**

[This profile for Plater](https://wago.io/ak3iS95aa) is among the most used and asked about public nameplate profiles for Moonkins, having customized colors for each NPC identity. 

### **Regrowth Tracker for Blooming Infusion**

[This weakaura](https://wago.io/BloomingInfusion) tracks your number of casts of Regrowth before you get the Blooming Infusion buff that increases the damage of your next Wrath/Starfire and makes them instant cast, and also tracks your number of Starsurge casts before you proc an instant Regrowth.

### **Casts until you can cast Starfire**

[Starfire Alerter](https://wago.io/rrtAyRQjF):
See the description of the WA for more details. This is not a required WA but will make it easier to not get into situations where you are wasting a Starfire cast inside Solar Eclipse.

### **Synergistic Brewtaliser**

[This weakaura](https://wago.io/rIj_5wU8P) will play a sound and show a timer whenever the trinket [Synergistic Brewtaliser](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219299/synergistic-brewterializer?bonus=4795&class=11&ilvl=678&spec=102) procs. The timer shows the latest barrel spawned.
