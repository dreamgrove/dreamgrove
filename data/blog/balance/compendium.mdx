### Elune's Chosen tier set

#### [2-piece](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1236332/druid-elunes-chosen-11-2-class-set-2pc)
> !Starfire! damage increased by 25%. Gaining Astral Power with !Starfire! has a 50% chance to launch a !Starsurge! at a victim of 50% effectiveness.

This is approximately ~8.4% dmg increase from having no set.

#### [4-piece](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1236333/druid-elunes-chosen-11-2-class-set-4pc)
> On impact, !197626|Starsurges! launched by !Starfire! split to up to 3 additional targets at 80% effectiveness and grand a stack of !Gathering Moonlight!. Casting !Fury of Elune! or !Full Moon! consumes Gathering Moonlight to increase your damage by 4% per stack for 12 sec.

This is approximately ~15.1% dmg increase from having no set.

### Keeper of the Grove tier set

#### [2-piece](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1236334/druid-keeper-of-the-grove-11-2-class-set-2pc)
> Casting !194223|CA! / !102560|Inc! calls upon the assistance of a !Dryad! for 10 sec that casts !Starsurge! at 360% effectiveness and !Starfall! at 800% effectiveness.

This is approximately ~7.2% dmg increase from having no set.

#### [4-piece](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1236336/druid-keeper-of-the-grove-11-2-class-set-4pc)
> When your Dryad fades, your next 2 !197626|Starsurges! damage for an additional amount equal to 3% of your damage done while it was active and splash 15% of their damage onto nearby enemies, reduced beyond 5 targets.

This is approximately ~18% dmg increase from having no set.

## Current Bugs

- There is currently a bug with the Keeper of the Grove 4-set bonus where you don't get the Dryad's Favor buff after the Dryad dies. The only boss it is confirmed to be bugged on currently is Plexus Sentinel, but it could also be bugged elsewhere. It is most likely a bug caused by the 4-set not counting the damage done to absorbs or shields towards the pool, probably caused by whatever Blizzard did during PTR when they fixed healing and overhealing contributing towards the pool.

- !Control of the Dream! does not give the proper CDR on the first use of the affecting spells if you wipe to a boss. You need to change talents in the choice node to fix it. You can use [this weakaura](https://wago.io/ControlBug) to change the choice node around by pressing a button in the middle of your screen.

- Changing talents from !Orbital Strike! to !Whirling Stars! can make macros using !194223|CA! / !102560|Inc! not work at all, giving you an error message and have your button be desaturated on your bars. This requires a relog to fix.

- If you spell-queue a free spender through a !Starweaver! or !Touch the Cosmos! proc as your first global in an !Eclipse!, you will gain no value from !Hail of Stars!.

<Collapsible title="How to Use Keeper of the Grove Tier Set">

The !Keeper of the Grove! tier set revolves around dumping as much damage as possible into your !Dryad! window to maximize the damage of your !Dryad's Favor! buff. 

The general way to play this in raid is to use !194223|CA! on pull after your !Moonfire! and !Sunfire!, then pressing !Force of Nature! 2 globals into your !194223|CA!. After pressing !Force of Nature! you immediately use !Convoke the Spirits!. 

As your !Dryad! fades and you gain !Dryad's Favor!, you press !194223|CA! again to dump the empowered !Starsurge! casts into a maxed out !Balance of All Things! and !Force of Nature! window.

After this opener you do the same sequence as your !Convoke the Spirits! is coming back, but without the 2nd use of !194223|CA!.

If you have !Potent Enchantments! talented you can fit another double use of !194223|CA! in at the 4 minute mark with your 3rd use of !Convoke the Spirits!.

Remember to pool Astral Power for when your !Dryad! fades and you gain !Dryad's Favor!, as the window to spend the buff before !Force of Nature! and !194223|CA! falls off is very tight.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="How to Use Warrior of Elune">

!Warrior of Elune! is an off-gcd ability, making your next 3 !Starfire! instant for 25 seconds. The ability has a 45s cooldown that starts once you've pressed it.

If you are playing !Lunar Calling! you should use your !Warrior of Elune! charges when you have no stacks of !Nature's Grace!.

When not talented into Lunar Calling, use !Warrior of Elune! with 7 seconds remaining on !Eclipse! and use the charges to enter Solar Eclipse. 
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="How to Use Owlkin Frenzy">
Use !Owlkin Frenzy! procs to enter Solar Eclipse, inside Lunar Eclipse or inside !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! if Starfire will hit 2 or more targets. Keep in mind that !Warrior of Elune! charges are consumed before !Owlkin Frenzy! procs.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="How to Use Whirling Stars">
!Whirling Stars! is a talent that changes your !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! cooldown to a charge system, with a 100s recharge. In Keeper of the Grove, you want to overlap these charges with !248280|Force of Nature! and !Convoke the Spirits! or just !248280|Force of Nature! if your !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! will recharge before !391528|Convoke! comes back off cooldown. 

In a raid scenario where you pull a boss with both charges up, you want to use your 1st charge on pull, and your 2nd charge when you gain [Dryad's Favor](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1236807/dryads-favor) during your !Force of Nature! window.

In an M+ scenario, if you're talented into !Incarnation: Chosen of Elune! instead of !391528|Convoke!, you want to use your !Whirling Stars! charges at any time where you can overlap with !248280|Force of Nature!.

When using !Elune's Chosen! and not talented into !391528|Convoke!, you can use !Whirling Stars! right after entering an !Eclipse! that procs !Sundered Firmament!, but this is not a major gain. If you're using !Elune's Chosen! and you're talented into !391528|Convoke!, you want to overlap your !Whirling Stars! charge with your !391528|Convoke! cooldown.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="How to Use Nature's Grace">

When using !Nature's Grace! you should make sure to start casting your !Wrath!/!Starfire! when the duration of your active !Eclipse! is shorter than the cast time of your !Wrath!/!Starfire!. This will make sure that you always keep 1 stack of !Nature's Grace! when entering your new !Eclipse!. This can be tricky to pull off consistently when cycling between !Lunar Eclipse!. Try to bank some AP for the end of !Eclipse! if you need to fill a GCD to time your !Wrath! cast correctly.

If you are approaching a pack in mythic+ you can cancelaura your !Nature's Grace! and spell-queue 2 !Wrath! casts while the tank is walking towards the pack before you've entered combat, this will make it so you are in !Lunar Eclipse! and have 2 stacks of !Nature's Grace! up for faster !Starfire! casts whenever you've finished spreading your dots. This can be tricky to pull off, especially if your tank is chaining a lot of packs. Keep in mind that the moment you enter combat, spreading !Sunfire! and !Moonfire! becomes the highest priority.

You can use the macro below and replace your existing !Wrath! keybind with it to cancel !Nature's Grace! when you're out of combat to help with this.

## Talent Explanations

<Collapsible title="Class Tree Talents">
### Top Section Explained
- After taking the mandatory defensive and offensive nodes in the top section of the tree, you are required to spend 1 more point before you can progress down the tree. 

  !Remove Corruption! and !Killer Instinct! are your options here. !Remove Corruption! is a poison/curse dispel, and is the preferred choice in most Mythic+ content, but does not offer a lot of value in raid. !Killer Instinct! increases your armor and physical damage done, which can give you a very minor damage increase if you are using !Convoke the Spirits! in melee range. 

  !Hibernate! is a viable option for pathing, but the spell has no real value in any current content.

### Middle Section Explained
- In the middle of the tree, you have noticeably more options to choose from. After choosing the mandatory talents in this section, there are 4 points to spend before you can progress further down the tree.

  Either !Feline Swiftness! and !Well-Honed Instincts! are necessary to progress down the left side of the tree. !Feline Swiftness! is a good movement speed talent, while !Well-Honed Instincts! gives a minor defensive every 90-120 seconds, depending on the talent below it. It is beneficial to take both options in reasonable content.

  Either one of !Typhoon! or the !Ursol's Vortex! node are needed to progress down the right side of the tree. They are both situational utilities you can use dependent on what content you're doing. You are likely to use both in Mythic+.

  !Matted Fur! is a very minor defensive talent that gives you a small shield when you press !Barkskin!.

  [Light of the Sun](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=202918/light-of-the-sun) reduces the cooldown of your !Solar Beam! by 15 seconds, making your interrupt have a 45 second cooldown instead of a 60 second cooldown. 

  !Astral Influence! increases the range of your spells by 5 yards. Good talent to take if you're in a situation where you need to outrange an ability. Good point to spend if you have no better options available.

### Bottom Section Explained
- After choosing the mandatory talents in this section of the tree, you're left with 4 more points to spend on optional talents.

  !Improved Stampeding Roar! is an often relied-upon option for progression fights where your raid can benefit from a group-wide movement speed increase. Talk to your raid leader and make the decision that's best for your group.

  !Nature's Vigil! is a situationally helpful talent for your raid. Talk to your raid leader and healer team and make a decision that's best for your progression when considering this talent. 

  !Forestwalk! is a situationally good node, giving you increased movement speed and healing received after casting !Regrowth!. This can be strong when paired with !Blooming Infusion! and !Protective Growth! for fights that require good defensive value.

  !Incapacitating Roar! is a good option to make use of in Mythic+.

  !Lycara's Inspiration! was reworked from previous season and now gives 3% AoE damage reduction when in Moonkin Form. This talent is okay defensively, but not mandatory.

  !Ursine Vigor! is a solid defensive node that increases your health and armor by 15% for the first 4 seconds of entering !Bear Form!. This talent is a solid choice in general. 

</Collapsible>
<Collapsible title="Spec Tree ">

- For the Balance Druid spec tree there are currently a solid number of talent iterations to choose from that don't provide a meaningful increase to your damage. Talents like !114107|Soul of the Forest!, !Crashing Star!, !Touch the Cosmos!, !Hail of Stars!, !Umbral Inspiration! and !Sundered Firmament! are mostly interchangeable in ST with Keeper of the Grove, which is the recommended hero talent for raid encounters. Below there will be short explanations for each talent. Keep in mind that most of these options don't provide any changes in your rotation or decision making.

### Top Section

- !Stellar Flare! is currently simming noticeably worse than !Wild Surges! on ST and is generally untakeable outside of niche situations where you can maintain dots on targets that are far apart. !Wild Surges! is the recommended choice for most content outside of the niche scenarios where !Stellar Flare! can be useful.
  
  !Nature's Balance! sims around 0.6% higher than !Twin Moons! on pure single target, but loses out whenever there are more targets, where you can benefit from !Twin Moons! spreading !Moonfire!.
  
  !Aetherial Kindling! is a preferred choice for any sustained AoE scenario where you can benefit from your DoT effects being extended. Very good for m+.

### Middle Section

- !Sunseeker Mushroom! is the preferred option over !Wild Mushroom! and is taken in most builds, both for single target and AoE. 
  
  !Stellar Amplification! is recommended for ST scenarios where you cast Starsurge enough to keep good uptime on it, taken for most raid encounters.
  
  !Touch the Cosmos! lost some power since the start of Season 2, heading into Season 3 it is an optional talent for Keeper of the Grove in ST scenarios, and a talent you never take as Elune's Chosen. The 11.2 Elune's Chosen tier set only procs when you generate Astral Power with !Starfire! which devalues any talent that increases Astral Power generation or ones that give you free spenders. 
  
  !Umbral Intensity! is a very good talent for both !Keeper of the Grove! and !Elune's Chosen!. It also routes towards !Astronomical Impact! which is a mandatory talent for Keeper of the Grove whenever playing the 4-set.
  
  !Astronomical Impact! is a mandatory talent whenever you're playing the Keeper of the Grove 4-set as a considerable amount of your damage relies on !Dryad's Favor! critting.
  
  !114107|Soul of the Forest! in itself is an okay talent in ST and the extra Astral Power generation can help you in dealing with spots in raid where there is a lot of movement. It is mandatory in AoE.
  
  !Crashing Star! is an optional talent in ST, and is good when paired with !114107|Soul of the Forest!.
  
  !Hail of Stars! is an optional talent in general for ST, but loses out on AoE because of diminishing returns on !Shooting Stars! when there are more targets.

### Bottom Section

- !Power of Goldrinn! got a buff heading into 11.1 and is recommended for all ST encounters.
  
  !Umbral Inspiration! can be swapped out on ST for another talent, but is generally recommended for all content.
  
  !Sundered Firmament! is optional for !Keeper of the Grove!, but mandatory for !Elune's Chosen! since it helps provide uptime for !Atmospheric Exposure!. 
  
  !Orbit Breaker! is good whenever paired with !Hail of Stars!, as the increased duration on !Solstice! helps saturate !Orbit Breaker! procs. 

  !Sundered Firmament! and !Orbit Breaker! both benefit from the damage increase from !Radiant Moonlight!.
  
  !Denizen of the Dream! is a strong single target node, but loses value in AoE scenarios. Recommended for all raid fights.

  !Fury of Elune! is a mandatory talent for !Elune's Chosen! and optional for !Keeper of the Grove!. If you use this talent for !Keeper of the Grove! you should aim to line the cast up with your cooldowns or whenever there are more targets up.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Elune's Chosen vs Keeper of the Grove">

The key differences between the two different hero trees lie mainly in their distinct damage profiles. !Elune's Chosen! has a very flat damage graph with solid damage over the fights duration and mainly revolves around keeping good uptime casting !Starfire!. This has been solidified in Season 3 with the [new tier set](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1236333/druid-elunes-chosen-11-2-class-set-4pc) reducing the value of generating Astral Power since you can only proc the free !Starsurge! casts whenever you generate Astral Power with !Starfire!. In ST scenarios you forego talents like !Nature's Balance!, !Rattle the Stars!, !Touch the Cosmos! and !Convoke the Spirits! because these either help generate !Astral Power! or reduce the cost of spenders. !Elune's Chosen! is generally a stronger pick in M+ as the flat damage profile fits a dungeon scenario better than !Keeper of the Grove!'s burst oriented cooldown windows.

!Keeper of the Grove! revolves around doing big damage in your !Force of Nature! window and using the window to fit all your high damaging abilities in. The [Season 3 tier set](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1236336/druid-keeper-of-the-grove-11-2-class-set-4pc) also plays into this, spawning a !Dryad! that does solid damage during its duration. 3% of the damage you do during the window your !Dryad! is active gets pooled into a buff increasing the damage of your next 2 !Starsurge! casts whenever the !Dryad! despawns. The damage profile from !Keeper of the Grove! fits well for raid content and is not as taxing as !Elune's Chosen! when it comes to movement.
The !Dryads Favor! buff is capped to 10x your intellect whenever the !Dryad! despawns. With 715 ilvl you will have around 120k intellect, which makes the cap be 1.2m, and means you will have to do 40m damage inside your !Dryad! window in order to hit this cap.

Since !Elune's Chosen! mainly revolves around casting !Starfire! and having uptime, it is natural that this hero tree values Haste more heavily, where as !Keeper of the Grove! values direct damage stats like Crit and Versatility more, this can cause a noticeable difference in your [Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear) when simming different talent builds.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Convoke the Spirits vs Incarnation: Chosen of Elune">
!Keeper of the Grove! compliments !391528|Convoke! pretty well when you use it with the dmg increase from !Harmony of the Grove! and !Celestial Alignment!. !391528|Convoke! is also good for priority damage and boss fights in M+. !Incarnation: Chosen of Elune! is good for AoE scenarios, or in situations where !391528|Convoke! would use spells on targets you don't want to hit.  !Incarnation: Chosen of Elune! also pairs well with !Whirling Stars! in M+, giving you very consistent cooldowns on most packs, and allows for more flexibility in when your damage spikes, as opposed to !391528|Convoke!. If you're playing !391528|Convoke! in M+, you should use it in AoE with the conditions outlined in the "Rotation" section.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Control of the Dream vs. Power of the Dream">
!Control of the Dream! lets you hold on to either !194223|Celestial Alignment!/!102560|Incarnation!, !391528|Convoke! or !205636|Force of Nature! for up to 15 seconds without losing a use, subtracting the amount of time you held the ability from its cooldown.

Depending on the fight timer, this talent is stronger than !Power of the Dream! which it shares a choice node with. As always, you should research the fight you are preparing for on [warcraftlogs](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/) or sim your character to make an educated guess.

## Embellishments & Crafted Items

For Season 3 and Manaforge Omega, crafting a [Two-Hand Staff](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222568/vagabonds-bounding-baton?bonus=10421:9633:8902:9627:12040:11300:8960:12053:12050:8791&class=11&crafted-stats=36:40&crafting-quality=8&hero=23&ilvl=720&spec=102) with [Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024/darkmoon-sigil-ascension) early will be a preferred option for most players. However, if you play in a decent guild and can acquire the [Voidglass Kris](https://www.wowhead.com/item=237728/voidglass-kris?bonus=1520) weapon from heroic, then crafting an [off-hand](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222566/vagabonds-torch?bonus=10421:9633:8902:9627:12050:11300:8960:8791:12053&class=11&crafted-stats=36:49&crafting-quality=8&hero=23&ilvl=720&spec=102) with [Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024/darkmoon-sigil-ascension) and spending the free Enchanted Runed Crest on [Bracers with Writhing Armor Banding](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219334/rune-branded-armbands?bonus=10421:9633:8902:9627:11109:8960:8793:12040:12373:12052:12050&class=11&crafted-stats=32:49&crafting-quality=8&hero=23&ilvl=704&spec=102) can be a bigger upgrade. 

Keep this in mind when simming your character to decide what your best option is.

---

Embellishments for this season don't offer a substantial gain, so it's important that you always sim your character using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear) before making any gearing decision, but here are some guidelines:

[Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024/darkmoon-sigil-ascension) and [Writhing Armor Banding](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506/writhing-armor-banding)

This is a solid all-round choice for both single target and AoE. The [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222561/darkmoon-sigil-ascension) can be crafted on any weapon. If you go this route, you should aim to craft this on a two-handed weapon early, and craft the [Writhing Armor Banding](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506/writhing-armor-banding) on a low stat budget slot, preferably on the belt or wrist slot. Keep in mind that this embellishment only stacks during combat, making it a lot less valuable in mythic+. This option is generally worse later in the season when you can get either of the weapons with special effects. 

---

[Duskthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222873/duskthread-lining) or [Dawnthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222869/dawnthread-lining)

These are buffs that give you versatility or critical strike when you're above 80% hp. They are decent choices for mythic+, depending on the uptime you can get. These embellishments can not be crafted on weapons or jewelry. If you go for this choice, you should aim to craft them on two low stat budget slots, notably the wrist or belt slots.

---

[Elemental Focusing Lens](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213770/elemental-focusing-lens)

This is a solid all-round choice for single target and mythic+. It's a random damage proc effect, where the type of damage is determined based on what kind of gems you are wearing. Equipping more gems or changing the type does not matter for the damage output. If you go for this choice, you should aim to craft two of them on low stat budget slots, notably the belt, ring, neck or wrist slots.

## Trinkets

> [!WARNING]
> Remember to always sim your character using [Top Gear on Raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). The following list is a rough estimate and assumes highest item level version of the trinkets and can change depending on tuning.

|  | [Gigazap's Zap-Cap](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=232545/gigazaps-zap-cap?bonus=4795&class=11&hero=24&ilvl=723&spec=102) | |
|  | [Incorporeal Essence-Gorger](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=246945/incorporeal-essence-gorger?bonus=12355:40:1572:10255&class=11&hero=24&ilvl=710&spec=102) | |
| **C Tier** | [Harvester's Edict](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=219317/harvesters-edict?bonus=4795&class=11&hero=24&ilvl=723&spec=102) | |
|  | [Mereldar's Toll](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=219313/mereldars-toll?bonus=4795&class=11&hero=24&ilvl=723&spec=102) | |

|  | [Miniscule Mailemental in an Envelope](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=185846/miniscule-mailemental-in-an-envelope?bonus=4795&hero=24&ilvl=723&spec=102) | |

[Trinket Sim](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/8ayaQKVpAn3N6BEQHzFXE5) (this sim will expire, contact Gamz on discord if it's currently broken)

## D.I.S.C Belt

The [Durable Information Securing Container](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=245964/durable-information-securing-container?bonus=1472:12291:12239&class=11&hero=24&ilvl=684&spec=102) belt from 11.1.7 is still okay going into the new season. You will likely replace this with hero track alternatives, but you should always sim yourself with [Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear) to make sure that replacing it is worth for you.

[Static Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1241250/static-charge?ilvl=701) gives versatility, [Critical Chain](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1241246/critical-chain?ilvl=701) gives crit, [Electric Current](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=1236961/electric-current) gives mastery and [Spark Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=1236273/spark-burst) gives haste and since they all perform close to each other the choice will depend on your character. **You should sim yourself on [Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear) to find out which one is best for you!**

## Reshii Wraps

In Season 3 we are getting the artifact cloak [Reshii Wraps](https://www.wowhead.com/item=235499/reshii-wraps). For information about how to unlock and upgrade the cloak check out the [WoWHead guide](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/the-war-within/reshii-wraps-artifact-cloak-unlock-upgrade).

For the secondary stats gained from the Fiber items you should just sim the best one for your character using [Top Gear on Raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). You can buy all of them from a Tailoring crafter and they do not consume when swapped around like gems.

# FAQ

### Q: Why can't I enter Solar Eclipse?

**A:** Because you are talented into !Lunar Calling!.

### Q: How can I proc !Waning Twilight! without !Wild Mushroom! or !Stellar Flare!?

**A:** With !Astral Smolder!.

### Q: I am talented into !Lycara's Teachings!, but the Mastery on my character panel is not showing right value, is it bugged?

**A:** The Mastery % displayed in your character panel shows the value of the !Astral Invocation! spell, which is the damage increased on targets affected by !Sunfire! and !Moonfire! and not the full effect of your Mastery.

### Q:What is Astral damage?

**A:** Astral damage is both Arcane and Nature damage. Effects that buff Nature spells also applies to Astral spells, and effects that buff Arcane spells likewise also applies to Astral spells. For example, Solar Eclipse multiplies the damage of all Nature & Astral spells by 1.15x, and Lunar Eclipse multiplies the damage of all Arcane & Astral spells by 1.15x. If you have both eclipses, Astral spells get 1.15 \* 1.15 = 1.3225x multiplier, while Nature & Arcane spells get 1.15x.

Keep in mind that class buffs only affect class spells so if a trinket does nature or arcane damage they are not affected by our buffs to these spell schools.

### Q: Do our dots snapshot?

**A:** No, all of our periodic damage (like !Moonfire!, !Sunfire!, !Stellar Flare!) do NOT snapshot, everything is dynamic. This means any dots gain/lose the damage bonus upon entering/leaving the Eclipse that buffs them and whenever any other stat/damage increases are applied/expire.

### Q: Is there a target count where spreading Sunfire or Moonfire is not worth it?

**A:** No, having your DoT effects up increases your damage done to the target. The conditions for spreading Sunfire and Moonfire are tied to how long the target will live, and not how many targets there are.

### Q: How do I sim for M+?

**A:** It is generally recommended that you steer away from simming unrealistic scenarios like "5 target 40 seconds" as they are likely to give skewed results. Balance Druid stats don't really change much depending on target count either, so you will be perfectly fine just using the default "1 target 5 minute patchwerk" options. If your intention is to sim for mythic+, you can use the [MDT Sim WeakAura](https://wago.io/LTwpBiuz_) which allows you to sim dungeon routes. Alternatively you can create a route using [Keystone Guru](https://keystone.guru/) and click the "simulate" option to generate a SimC string. Please keep in mind that ST damage is still a big part of mythic+.

### Q: I've seen a lot of people running build X instead of Y in Mythic+, is X better?

**A:** Try them out and make an informed decision! Most differences between builds are based on variables like target count, comps, combat timer or utility needed.

### Q: I'm doing really low damage in Mythic+, what am I doing wrong?

**A:**  If you double-checked your rotation and still feel like you're underperforming you could just be playing low keys, together with classes that have very bursty damage profiles. When playing a Balance Druid, mobs need to live long enough for you to actually start doing damage, which is something that doesn't really happen in keys lower than 12+. Consider focusing a bit more on ST or trying another spec, but take into account the fact that DPS isn't everything in a key.

### Q: I've read the priority list and I think my rotation looks correct but I'm still doing very low damage. What could be the reason?

**A:** Log one of your fights and check it with [warcraftlogs](https://articles.warcraftlogs.com/help/how-to-navigate-through-logs) and [wowanalyzer](https://wowanalyzer.com/). The main thing to check is if you're always casting: the timeline should have no downtime and, as close to zero as possible, cancelled casts. Another common issue is incorrectly planning your movement and wasting casts on dots: you should always have enough AP to cover some distance just by using spenders.

### Q: I have read through the Compendium and I have some questions that are not outlined in this FAQ?

**A:**  If you have any questions, you can go to the [Dreamgrove discord server](https://discord.gg/XaZ3uXJc) and then ask in there. This guide should cover everything you need, but there could always be some things left out or not considered. Remember, you are not guaranteed to receive the answer you would like.

## Cancelaura Macros

### **Cancelling Starlord**

**Cancelling Starlord is entirely optional and is neither a DPS gain nor loss.**

If you want to engage in this entirely optional method without incurring a DPS loss, you should aim to cancel Starlord at any point in an Eclipse window where the buff is currently at less than two seconds, and you are about to use !Starsurge! to prevent overcapping.

```

/cancelaura Starlord
```

### **Cancelling Dreamstate**

## Useful WeakAuras and Other Profiles

### **Balance WeakAura Packs**

The following links lead to various Balance Druid WeakAura packs. These contain everything that's recommended to track to play at a high level. None of these are particular better or more useful than others, and which one you should use is up to your personal preference.

- [Oi Balance pack](https://wago.io/OiBalance)
- [Shrom's Ultimate AP Bar](https://wago.io/GzpP7i8ic)
- [LuckyOneUI Druid](https://wago.io/LuckyoneUI-Druid)
- [Afenar The War Within](https://wago.io/HkrSdHFMG)
- [Shrom's AP Bar - Standalone](https://wago.io/J5V9sTM0F)

### **Jundies Plater Profile**

[This profile for Plater](https://wago.io/ak3iS95aa) is among the most used and asked about public nameplate profiles for Moonkins, having customized color and priority depending on the type of mob in M+.

### **Regrowth Tracker for Blooming Infusion**

[This weakaura](https://wago.io/BloomingInfusion) tracks your number of casts of Regrowth before you get the Blooming Infusion buff that increases the damage of your next Wrath/Starfire and makes them instant cast, and also tracks your number of Starsurge casts before you proc an instant Regrowth.

### **Casts until you can cast Starfire**

[Starfire Alerter](https://wago.io/rrtAyRQjF):
See the description of the WA for more details. This is not a required WA but will make it easier to not get into situations where you are wasting a Starfire cast inside Solar Eclipse.
