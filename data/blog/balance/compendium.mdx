# News

## 29th October tuning
  - The tuning on the weekly reset is a 5% buff to single target and a 2% buff to your regular M+ dungeon. All builds using !Keeper of the Grove! now include !Soul of the Forest! and !Crashing Star! after the buffs to spenders and !Crashing Star!. The nerf to !New Moon! makes this talent not preferred anymore.


## Current Bugs
- !Control of the Dream! does not provide the correct CDR value if your raid wipes after you use your cooldowns. The temporary fix to this is to talent into !Power of the Dream! in the choice node, swap back and then wait 15 seconds for the CDR to finish counting. 

- !194223|Celestial Alignment!/!102560|Incarnation! does not reset on encounter end. After Blizzard introduced the talent !Whirling Stars!, they made !194223|CA!/!102560|INC! work on a charge system. Even without !Whirling Stars! or !Orbital Strike! talented, it still counts as having 1 charge. While both spells continue to reset their **cooldowns** on wipe, as they are now charges they require a different set of conditions to allow **charges** to reset on wipe, which they do not have. Furthermore they are not properly coded to be reduced by "faster recharge" effects such as Blessing of Autumn and Xal'atath's Bargain: Voidbound. The temporary way to work around this is to change spec into Guardian with !Whirling Stars! talented and earn a charge back. This fix does not work without !Whirling Stars! talented and will in worst case scenario make your raid have to wait 2 minutes for your cooldowns to come back.


## Tier set

#### [2-piece](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=453666/druid-balance-11-0-class-set-2pc#used-by-item-set)

>!Starsurge! damage increased by 10%. !Starfall! damage increased by 14%.

This is a ~3.0% dmg increase from having no set.

#### [4-piece](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=453667/druid-balance-11-0-class-set-4pc)

>Lunar Eclipse and Solar Eclipse each increase the Astral Power !Wrath! generates by 2 and !Starfire! generates by 5.

This is a ~4.7% dmg increase from having no set.

## Rotational Details

### Eclipses and Fillers

- Enter !Solar Eclipse! and cast !Wrath! if !Starfire! can only hit 1 target.
- Enter !Lunar Eclipse! and cast !Starfire! if !Starfire! can hit 2 targets and more.
- If talented into !Lunar Calling!, enter !Lunar Eclipse! on all target counts.
- Use !Starsurge! on 1 target.
- Use !Starfall! on 2 targets and more.

<Collapsible title="How to Use Warrior of Elune">

!Warrior of Elune! is an off-gcd ability, making your next 3 !Starfire! instant for 25 seconds. The ability has a 45s cooldown that starts once you've pressed it. It should be used on cooldown while talented into Lunar Calling, or you can hold for a few seconds to line up with !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation!.

When not talented into Lunar Calling, use !Warrior of Elune! charges to enter Solar Eclipse. 
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="How to Use Owlkin Frenzy">
Use !Owlkin Frenzy! procs to enter Solar Eclipse, inside Lunar Eclipse or inside !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! if Starfire will hit 2 or more targets. Keep in mind that !Warrior of Elune! charges are consumed before !Owlkin Frenzy! procs.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="How to Use Whirling Stars">
!Whirling Stars! is a talent that changes your !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! cooldown to a charge system, with a 100s recharge. In Keeper of the Grove, you want to overlap these charges with !248280|Force of Nature! and !Convoke the Spirits! or just !248280|Force of Nature! if your !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! will recharge before !391528|Convoke! comes back off cooldown. 

In a raid scenario where you pull a boss with both charges up, you want to use your 1st charge on pull, and your 2nd charge together with your 2nd or 3rd set of !248280|Force of Nature! treants, and save your 3rd charge for !391528|Convoke! at 2 minutes. After this, you just use aim to overlap all 3 cooldowns with the priority outlined in rotation section.

In an M+ scenario, if you're talented into !Incarnation: Chosen of Elune! instead of !391528|Convoke!, you want to use your !Whirling Stars! charges at any time where you can overlap with !Force of Nature!.

When using !Elune's Chosen! and not talented into !Convoke!, you can use !Whirling Stars! right after entering an !Eclipse! that procs !Sundered Firmament!, but this is not a major gain. If you're using !Elune's Chosen! and you're talented into !391528|Convoke!, you want to overlap your !Whirling Stars! charge with your !391528|Convoke! cooldown.

The following are dungeon talent builds that will always serve you well but mind that there can be some variations based on your group comp or affixes. Do not be afraid of swapping some talents out if you think it can help your group.

Both hero trees are viable and perform very close to each other. Feel free to choose the one you prefer.

<div className="border border-gray-300 mb-2">
![EC Talents](/static/images/EC_Tree.png)
</div>
  <Collapsible title="Top Section Talents Explained ">
!Nature's Balance! sims around 0.4% higher than !Twin Moons! on pure single target, but loses out whenever there are more targets, where you can benefit from !Twin Moons! spreading !Moonfire!.

!Aetherial Kindling! is a preferred choice for any sustained AoE scenario where you can benefit from your DoT effects being extended. Very good for m+.

!Stellar Flare! sims 0.5% higher than !Wild Surges! on pure single target, but !Wild Surges! generally performs better in AoE scenarios. !Stellar Flare! also gains value whenever you run !Whirling Stars!, since it guarantees uptime on !Waning Twilight! and loses value when you run !Orbital Strike!, since !Orbital Strike! also applies !Stellar Flare! to the targets hit. Putting a point into this node is mandatory, but you can choose to take !Wild Surges! on ST for a DPS loss if you don't like applying Stellar Flare.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Middle Section Talents Explained ">

For the middle part of the spec tree, you have 9 points you put into mandatory talents, leaving you with just 2 more points to spend before you can continue down the tree. The options you have in the bottom part of the tree are not particularly stronger, so you generally end up spending more points than needed in this section.

!Stellar Amplification! is recommended for raid, or scenarios where you cast Starsurge enough to keep good uptime on it.

!114107|Soul of the Forest! is a mandatory node for !Keeper of the Grove!, but it is only good for !Elune's Chosen! in AoE scenarios since !Lunar Calling! makes it untakeable if !Starfire! only hits 1 target.

!Crashing Star!, !Sunseeker Mushroom!  and !Astronomical Impact! are all largely interchangeable.

!Touch the Cosmos! is an optional talent if you want more RNG in your rotation. There are generally better options to take, but if you want you can swap out !Astronomical Impact! or !Sunseeker Mushroom! for this.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Bottom Section Talents Explained ">

!Power of Goldrinn! is another ST damage proc talent you can take for raid encounters.

!Sundered Firmament! is optional for !Keeper of the Grove!, but mandatory for !Elune's Chosen! since it helps provide uptime for !Atmopsheric Exposure!.

!Denizen of the Dream! is one of your strongest single target nodes, but it loses value in AoE scenarios. Recommended for all raid fights.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Convoke the Spirits vs Incarnation: Chosen of Elune">
!Keeper of the Grove! compliments !Convoke the Spirits! pretty well in when you use it with the dmg increase from !Harmony of the Grove! and !Celestial Alignment!. !Convoke the Spirits! is also good for priority damage and boss fights in M+. !Incarnation: Chosen of Elune! is good for AoE scenarios, or in situations like the last boss in Ara'Kara where !Convoke the Spirits! would use spells on targets you don't want to hit. If you're playing !Convoke the Spirits! in M+, you should use it in AoE with the conditions outlined in the "Rotation" section.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Control of the Dream vs. Power of the Dream">
!Control of the Dream! lets you hold on to either !194223|Celestial Alignment!/!102560|Incarnation!, !Convoke the Spirits! or !205636|Force of Nature! for up to 15 seconds without losing a use, subtracting the amount of time you held the ability from its cooldown.

Depending on the fight timer, this talent is stronger than !Power of the Dream! which it shares a choice node with. As always, you should research the fight you are preparing for on [warcraftlogs](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/) or sim your character to make an educated guess.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Class Tree Talents">
In general, the Druid class tree leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to variety and how many points you have left to spend after taking talents that are mandatory for the content you're doing. Listed below are some talents that you can opt into based on preference, comp or what content you're doing.

!Feline Swiftness! is a strong node in raid. A 15% passive movement speed increase for a 2 point investment is very good for handling sudden movement. This node is not as good to take in mythic+ when there are more mandatory talents to choose there. For a pure single target fight you should also drop !Improved Sunfire! to free up another talent point.

!Remove Corruption! is a good node for mythic+ if the content you are doing requires a Poison or Curse dispel. Some people are opting to not play !Verdant Heart! in order to access this, while others are removing points spent in CC talents like !Typhoon! or !Incapacitating Roar!.

!Matted Fur!, !Ursine Vigor! and !Ursoc's Spirit! are all defensive nodes. Both !Ursine Vigor! and !Ursoc's Spirit! provides more health while in !Bear Form!, where !Matted Fur! gives you a tiny absorb shield when using !Barkskin!. Assuming you are using !Bear Form! defensively, both those talents are stronger than !Matted Fur!. Most top players are opting in to using !Ursine Vigor!, with !Matted Fur! being an option to consider only if you never use !Bear Form!.

!Typhoon! is a talent that lets you knock back adds to stop them from casting or to reposition mobs that are standing outside of the pack. This talent is taken in most mythic+ scenarios, but you can remove it depending on your comp or what dungeon you're doing. This is best used when paired with !Ursol's Vortex! so the mobs don't get spread too far out. Tanks will call you out on using this poorly since they won't be able to parry hits from behind them, use at your own discretion. 

!Fluid Form! is a very strong talent if used right. Most players are sacrificing points elsewhere in order to take this. It allows you to save a GCD every time you want to cycle back into !Moonkin Form!. It's very strong against mechanics that root you, allowing you to cancel your form in the middle of casting a !Wrath! and break the roots when shifting back with your next !Wrath!.

!Innervate! is a good node for raid, but not as easy to take in mythic+. Communicate with your raid leader and healers on the best use for this on a particular fight. If your healers are not asking for your !Innervate!, consider talenting out of it for another defensive option.

!Oakskin! is a good defensive talent that is good to take for every scenario. Accessing this section of talents forces you to route through !Instincts of the Claw! which is useless for Balance Druid.

!Incapacitating Roar! is a good node for mythic+ where AoE stops are sometimes mandatory. 

!Well-Honed Instincts! is another defensive node that you can take if necessary.

!Forestwalk! is a situationally good node, giving you increased movement speed and healing recieved after casting !Regrowth!. This can be strong when paired with !Blooming Infusion! and !Protective Growth! for fights that require good defensive value. Some top players are opting in to play this talent as an alternative when they don't want to route through !Instincts of the Claw!.

!Nature's Vigil! is not an easy node to take, but could be situationally helpful for your guild. Talk to your raid leader and make a decision that's best for your raid.

!Improved Stampeding Roar! is an option for fights with mechanics where your raid can benefit from a movement speed increase, like Rasha'nan intermission or spreading out for charges on Nexus Princess Kyveza. Talk to your raid leader and make a decision that's best for your raid.

## Embellishments & Crafted Items

Embellishments for this season don't offer a substantial gain, so it's important that you always sim your character using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear) before making any gearing decision, but here are some guidelines:

[Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024/darkmoon-sigil-ascension) and [Writhing Armor Banding](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506/writhing-armor-banding)
  - This is a solid all-round choice for both single target and AoE. The [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222561/darkmoon-sigil-ascension) can be crafted on any weapon. If you go this route, you should aim to craft this on a two-handed weapon early, and crafting the [Writhing Armor Banding](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506/writhing-armor-banding) on a low stat budget slot, preferably on the cloak, belt or wrist slot. Keep in mind that this embellishment only stacks during combat, making it a lot less valuable in mythic+. For later in the season when you acquire a 639 weapon, you should recraft the Ascension embellishment on an off-hand.

[Elemental Focusing Lens](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213770/elemental-focusing-lens)
  - This is a solid all-round choice for single target and mythic+. It's a random damage proc effect, where the type of damage is determined based on what kind of gems you are wearing. Equipping more gems or changing the type does not matter for the damage output. If you go for this choice, you should aim to craft two of them on low stat budget slots, notably the cloak, belt or wrist slots.

[Duskthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222873/duskthread-lining) or [Dawnthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222869/dawnthread-lining)
  - These are buffs that give you versatility or critical strike when you're above 80% hp. They are decent choices for mythic+, depending on the uptime you can get. They're similiar to the Blue Silken Lining embellishment from Dragonflight. If you go for this choice, you should aim to craft them on two low stat budget slots, notably the cloak, wrist or belt slots.

Remember that you will acquire an enchanted heroic crest early in the season as a quest reward, allowing you to craft a 619 item without spending any of your crests.

## Trinkets

[Spymaster's Web](https://www.wowhead.com/item=220202/spymasters-web) is a trinket with a passively stacking intellect buff, capping at 40 stacks and an on-use effect that gives you intellect based on the amount of stacks you've accumulated. Ideally this means you should save it for your 3rd or 2nd use of !194223|Celestial Alignment!/!102560|Incarnation!, depending on fight timer. 

[Treacherous Transmitter](https://www.wowhead.com/item=221023/treacherous-transmitter?ilvl=639&spec=102) is an on-use trinket that gives you a random task to perform out of 3 possible tasks, either collect an orb, stand in a circle or jump 3 times to get a primary stat buff. This trinket is good paired with !Keeper of the Grove!'s burst cooldowns, but not as good for !Elune's Chosen! as it has a more flat damage profile.

Please use Top Gear on [Raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot) in order to decide what trinkets to use/farm, but the following list should give you a good idea of some of the trinkets you will want to look out for.

# FAQ

### Why can't I enter Solar Eclipse?

- Because you are talented into !Lunar Calling!.

### How can I proc !Waning Twilight! without !Wild Mushroom! or !Stellar Flare!?

- With !Astral Smolder!.

### I've read the priority list and I think my rotation looks correct but I'm still doing very low damage. What could be the reason?

- Log one of your fights and check it with [warcraftlogs](https://articles.warcraftlogs.com/help/how-to-navigate-through-logs) and [wowanalyzer](https://wowanalyzer.com/). The main thing to check is if you're always casting: the timeline should have no downtime and, as close to zero as possible, cancelled casts. Another common issue is incorrectly planning your movement and wasting casts on dots: you should always have enough AP to cover some distance just by using spenders.

### What is Astral damage?

- Astral damage is both Arcane and Nature damage. Effects that buff Nature spells also applies to Astral spells, and effects that buff Arcane spells likewise also applies to Astral spells. For example, Solar Eclipse multiplies the damage of all Nature & Astral spells by 1.15x, and Lunar Eclipse multiplies the damage of all Arcane & Astral spells by 1.15x. If you have both eclipses, Astral spells get 1.15 \* 1.15 = 1.3225x multiplier, while Nature & Arcane spells get 1.15x.

- Mind that class buffs only affect class spells so if a trinket does nature or arcane damage they are not affected by our buffs to these spell schools.

### Is there a target count where spreading Sunfire or Moonfire is not worth it?

- No, having your DoT effects up increases your damage done to the target. The conditions for spreading Sunfire and Moonfire are tied to how long the target will live, and not how many targets there are.

### How do I sim for M+?

- It is generally recommended that you steer away from simming unrealistic scenarios like "5 target 40 seconds" as they are likely to give skewed results. Balance Druid stats don't really change much depending on target count either, so you will be perfectly fine just using the default "1 target 5 minute patchwerk" options. If your intention is to sim for mythic+, you can use the [MDT Sim WeakAura](https://wago.io/Yya4XBbl-) which allows you to sim dungeon routes. Please keep in mind that ST damage is still a big part of mythic+.

### I'm doing really low damage in Mythic+, what am I doing wrong?

- If you double-checked your rotation and still feel like you're underperforming you could just be playing low keys, together with classes that have very bursty damage profiles. When playing a Balance Druid, mobs need to live long enough for you to actually start doing damage, which is something that doesn't really happen in keys lower than 12+. Consider focusing a bit more on ST or trying another spec, but take into account the fact that DPS isn't everything in a key.

### I've seen a lot of people running build X instead of Y in Mythic+, is X better?

- Try them out and make an informed decision! Most differences between builds are based on variables like target count, comps, combat timer or utility needed.

### Why are some top players running different embellishments from the ones mentioned in the Compendium

- The DPS gain provided by the embellishments can vary significantly because of many external factors such as gear, type of content and group composition. Some of the top players might also happen to use niche embellishments for the same reasons. If you don't have any specific requirements then your best option is to just sim your character and choose the embellishments that provide the highest DPS upgrade.

### Do our dots snapshot?

- No, all of our periodic damage (like !Moonfire!, !Sunfire!, !Stellar Flare!) do NOT snapshot, everything is dynamic. That means any dots gain/lose the damage bonus upon entering/leaving the Eclipse that buffs them and whenever any other stat/damage increases are applied/expire.

### I have read through the Compendium and I have some questions that are not outlined in this FAQ?

- If you have any questions, you can go to the [Dreamgrove discord server](https://discord.gg/XaZ3uXJc) and then ask in there. This guide should cover everything you need, but there could always be some things left out or not considered. Remember, you are not guaranteed to receive the answer you would like.

## Cancelaura Macros

### **Cancelling Starlord**

**Cancelling Starlord is entirely optional and is neither a DPS gain nor loss.**

If you want to engage in this entirely optional method without incurring a DPS loss, you should aim to cancel Starlord at any point in an Eclipse window where the buff is currently at less than two seconds, and you are about to use !Starsurge! to prevent overcapping.

```
#showtooltip
/cancelaura Starlord
```

## Useful WeakAuras and Other Profiles

### **Balance WeakAura Packs**

The following links lead to various Balance Druid WeakAura packs. These contain everything that's recommended to track to play at a high level. None of these are particular better or more useful than others, and which one you should use is up to your personal preference.

- [Shrom's Ultimate AP Bar](https://wago.io/GzpP7i8ic)
- [Oi Balance pack](https://wago.io/OiBalance)
- [LuckyOneUI Druid](https://wago.io/LuckyoneUI-Druid)
- [Afenar The War Within](https://wago.io/HkrSdHFMG)
- [Shrom's AP Bar - Standalone](https://wago.io/J5V9sTM0F)

### Jundies Plater Profile

[This profile for Plater](https://wago.io/ak3iS95aa) is among the most used and asked about public nameplate profiles for moonkins, since it changes the color of a mobs nameplate based on what DoT effects are currently active on the target, being very helpful to more accurately spread your Sunfire and Moonfire when fighting multiple mobs at the same time.

### **Regrowth Tracker for Blooming Infusion**

[This weakaura](https://wago.io/BloomingInfusion) tracks your number of casts of Regrowth before you get the Blooming Infusion buff that increases the damage of your next Wrath/Starfire and makes them instant cast, and also tracks your number of Starsurge casts before you proc an instant Regrowth.

### **Casts until you can cast Starfire**

[Starfire Alerter](https://wago.io/rrtAyRQjF):
See the description of the WA for more details. This is not a required WA but will make it easier to not get into situations where you are wasting a Starfire cast inside Solar Eclipse.
