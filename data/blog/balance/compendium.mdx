## Tier set

#### [2-piece](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1215695/druid-balance-11-1-class-set-2pc)

>Your damaging spells have a chance to hit a Jackpot, growing a !Wild Mushroom! at a nearby enemy's location at 100% effectiveness. Casting !CA/INC! always hits a Jackpot.

This is a ~X% dmg increase from having no set.

#### [4-piece](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1215698/druid-balance-11-1-class-set-4pc)

>Starfall and Starsurge damage against targets affected by your !Wild Mushroom!'s damage over time effect is increased by 20%.

This is a ~X% dmg increase from having no set.

## Current Bugs

- Changing talents from !Orbital Strike! to !Whirling Stars! can make macros using !194223|CA!/!102560|Inc! not work at all, giving you an error message and have your button be desaturated on your bars. This requires a relog to fix.

- !Control of the Dream! does not provide the correct CDR value if your raid wipes after you use your cooldowns. The temporary fix to this is to talent into !Power of the Dream! in the choice node, swap back and then wait 15 seconds for the CDR to finish counting. There is a Weakaura to make this process easier that you can find by clicking [here](https://wago.io/ControlBug). You can read the description on the Wago page for how it works.

You can precast from max range, 4 seconds before a boss is pulled.

### **What is a priority list?**

When reading the priority lists below, you should not think of these as steps to be followed in a specific order. At any given point in combat, you should cast the first ability on the list that you are able to cast, provided the conditions for its use are met.

## Single Target Priority

## Rotational Details

### Eclipses and Fillers

- Enter !Solar Eclipse! and cast !Wrath! if !Starfire! can only hit 1 target.
- Enter !Lunar Eclipse! and cast !Starfire! if !Starfire! can hit 2 targets and more.
- If talented into !Lunar Calling!, enter !Lunar Eclipse! and use !Starfire! on all target counts.
- Use !Starsurge! on 1 target.
- Use !Starfall! on 2 targets and more.

<Collapsible title="How to Use Warrior of Elune">

!Warrior of Elune! is an off-gcd ability, making your next 3 !Starfire! instant for 25 seconds. The ability has a 45s cooldown that starts once you've pressed it. It should be used on cooldown while talented into Lunar Calling, or you can hold for a few seconds to line up with !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation!.

When not talented into Lunar Calling, use !Warrior of Elune! charges to enter Solar Eclipse. 
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="How to Use Owlkin Frenzy">
Use !Owlkin Frenzy! procs to enter Solar Eclipse, inside Lunar Eclipse or inside !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! if Starfire will hit 2 or more targets. Keep in mind that !Warrior of Elune! charges are consumed before !Owlkin Frenzy! procs.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="How to Use Whirling Stars">
!Whirling Stars! is a talent that changes your !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! cooldown to a charge system, with a 100s recharge. In Keeper of the Grove, you want to overlap these charges with !248280|Force of Nature! and !Convoke the Spirits! or just !248280|Force of Nature! if your !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! will recharge before !391528|Convoke! comes back off cooldown. 

In a raid scenario where you pull a boss with both charges up, you want to use your 1st charge on pull, and your 2nd charge together with your 2nd or 3rd set of !248280|Force of Nature! treants, and save your 3rd charge for !391528|Convoke! at 2 minutes. After this, you just aim to overlap all 3 cooldowns with the priority outlined in rotation section.

In an M+ scenario, if you're talented into !Incarnation: Chosen of Elune! instead of !391528|Convoke!, you want to use your !Whirling Stars! charges at any time where you can overlap with !248280|Force of Nature!.

When using !Elune's Chosen! and not talented into !391528|Convoke!, you can use !Whirling Stars! right after entering an !Eclipse! that procs !Sundered Firmament!, but this is not a major gain. If you're using !Elune's Chosen! and you're talented into !391528|Convoke!, you want to overlap your !Whirling Stars! charge with your !391528|Convoke! cooldown.

## Mythic+

The following are dungeon talent builds that will always serve you well but mind that there can be some variations based on your group comp or affixes. Do not be afraid of swapping some talents out if you think it can help your group.

Both hero trees are viable and perform very close to each other. Feel free to choose the one you prefer. For additional information on what talents you can swap out for other specific talents, check the [talent explanation section below.](https://www.dreamgrove.gg/blog/balance/compendium#talent-explanations)

![Class Tree](/static/images/CLASSTREE.png)
  <Collapsible title="Top Section Talents Explained ">
!Nature's Balance! sims around 0.4% higher than !Twin Moons! on pure single target, but loses out whenever there are more targets, where you can benefit from !Twin Moons! spreading !Moonfire!.

!Aetherial Kindling! is a preferred choice for any sustained AoE scenario where you can benefit from your DoT effects being extended. Very good for m+.

!Stellar Flare! sims 0.5% higher than !Wild Surges! on pure single target, but !Wild Surges! generally performs better in AoE scenarios. !Stellar Flare! also gains value whenever you run !Whirling Stars!, since it guarantees uptime on !Waning Twilight! and loses value when you run !Orbital Strike!, since !Orbital Strike! also applies !Stellar Flare! to the targets hit. Putting a point into this node is mandatory, but you can choose to take !Wild Surges! on ST for a DPS loss if you don't like applying Stellar Flare.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Middle Section Talents Explained ">

For the middle part of the spec tree, you have 9 points you put into mandatory talents, leaving you with just 2 more points to spend before you can continue down the tree. The options you have in the bottom part of the tree are not particularly stronger, so you generally end up spending more points than needed in this section.

!Stellar Amplification! is recommended for raid, or scenarios where you cast Starsurge enough to keep good uptime on it.

!114107|Soul of the Forest! is a mandatory node for !Keeper of the Grove!, but it is only good for !Elune's Chosen! in AoE scenarios since !Lunar Calling! makes it untakeable if !Starfire! only hits 1 target.

!Crashing Star!, !Sunseeker Mushroom!  and !Astronomical Impact! are all largely interchangeable.

!Touch the Cosmos! is an optional talent if you want more RNG in your rotation. There are generally better options to take, but if you want you can swap out !Astronomical Impact! or !Sunseeker Mushroom! for this.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Bottom Section Talents Explained ">

!Power of Goldrinn! is another ST damage proc talent you can take for raid encounters.

!Sundered Firmament! is optional for !Keeper of the Grove!, but mandatory for !Elune's Chosen! since it helps provide uptime for !Atmopsheric Exposure!.

!Orbit Breaker! is a good talent paired with !Keeper of the Grove! in M+.

!Denizen of the Dream! is a strong single target node, but loses value in AoE scenarios. Recommended for all raid fights.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Convoke the Spirits vs Incarnation: Chosen of Elune">
!Keeper of the Grove! compliments !391528|Convoke! pretty well in when you use it with the dmg increase from !Harmony of the Grove! and !Celestial Alignment!. !391528|Convoke! is also good for priority damage and boss fights in M+. !Incarnation: Chosen of Elune! is good for AoE scenarios, or in situations like the last boss in Ara'Kara where !391528|Convoke! would use spells on targets you don't want to hit.  !Incarnation: Chosen of Elune! also pairs well with !Whirling Stars! in M+, giving you very consistent cooldowns on most packs, and allows for more flexibility in when your damage spikes, as opposed to !391528|Convoke!. If you're playing !391528|Convoke! in M+, you should use it in AoE with the conditions outlined in the "Rotation" section.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Control of the Dream vs. Power of the Dream">
!Control of the Dream! lets you hold on to either !194223|Celestial Alignment!/!102560|Incarnation!, !391528|Convoke! or !205636|Force of Nature! for up to 15 seconds without losing a use, subtracting the amount of time you held the ability from its cooldown.

Depending on the fight timer, this talent is stronger than !Power of the Dream! which it shares a choice node with. As always, you should research the fight you are preparing for on [warcraftlogs](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/) or sim your character to make an educated guess.
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Class Tree Talents">

The Druid class tree has received a rework for 11.1 with better pathing and more freedom to take useful talents. Below, you will find a graphic outlining what talents are mandatory and what talents are optional for each section of the tree, together with explanations for the options you have.

After taking the mandatory defensive and offensive nodes in the top section of the tree, you are required to spend 1 more point before you can progress down the tree. 

!Remove Corruption!, !Killer Instinct! and !Thrash! are your options here. !Remove Corruption! is a poison/curse dispel, and is the preferred choice is most Mythic+ content, but does not offer a lot of value in raid. !Killer Instinct! increases your armor and physical damage done, which can give you a very minor damage increase if you are using !Convoke the Spirits! in melee range. 

!Hibernate! is a viable option for pathing, but the spell has no real value in any current content.


In the middle of the tree, you have noticeably more options to choose from. After choosing the mandatory talents in this section, there are 4 points to spend before you can progress further down the tree.

Either !Feline Swiftness! and !Well-Honed Instincts! are necessary to progress down the left side of the tree. !Feline Swiftness! is a good movement speed talent, while !Well-Honed Instincts! gives a minor defensive every 90-120 seconds, depending on the talent below it. It is beneficial to take both options in reasonable content.

Either one of !Typhoon! or the !Ursol's Vortex! node are needed to progress down the right side of the tree. They are both situational utilities you can use dependent on what content you're doing. You are likely to use both in Mythic+.

!Matted Fur! is a very minor defensive talent that gives you a small shield when you press !Barkskin!.

!Light of the Sun! reduces the cooldown of your !Solar Beam! by 15 seconds, making your interrupt have a 45 second cooldown instead of a 60 second cooldown. 

!Astral Influence! increases the range of your spells by 5 yards.

After choosing the mandatory talents in this section of the tree, 4 talent points remain. 

!Improved Stampeding Roar! is an often relied-upon option for progression fights where your raid can benefit from a  group-wide movement speed increase. Talk to your raid leader and make the decision that's best for your group.

!Nature's Vigil! is a situationally helpful talent for your raid. Talk to your raid leader and healer team and make a decision that's best for your progression when considering this talent. 

!Forestwalk! is a situationally good node, giving you increased movement speed and healing received after casting !Regrowth!. This can be strong when paired with !Blooming Infusion! and !Protective Growth! for fights that require good defensive value.

!Incapacitating Roar! is a good option to make use of in Mythic+.

!Ursine Vigor! is a solid defensive node that increases your health and armor by 15% for the first 4 seconds of entering !Bear Form!. This talent is a solid choice in general.

## Embellishments & Crafted Items

Embellishments for this season don't offer a substantial gain, so it's important that you always sim your character using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear) before making any gearing decision, but here are some guidelines:

[Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024/darkmoon-sigil-ascension) and [Writhing Armor Banding](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506/writhing-armor-banding)
  - This is a solid all-round choice for both single target and AoE. The [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222561/darkmoon-sigil-ascension) can be crafted on any weapon. If you go this route, you should aim to craft this on a two-handed weapon early, and crafting the [Writhing Armor Banding](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506/writhing-armor-banding) on a low stat budget slot, preferably on the cloak, belt or wrist slot. Keep in mind that this embellishment only stacks during combat, making it a lot less valuable in mythic+. For later in the season when you acquire a 639 weapon, you should recraft the Ascension embellishment on an off-hand.

[Elemental Focusing Lens](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213770/elemental-focusing-lens)
  - This is a solid all-round choice for single target and mythic+. It's a random damage proc effect, where the type of damage is determined based on what kind of gems you are wearing. Equipping more gems or changing the type does not matter for the damage output. If you go for this choice, you should aim to craft two of them on low stat budget slots, notably the cloak, belt or wrist slots.

[Duskthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222873/duskthread-lining) or [Dawnthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222869/dawnthread-lining)
  - These are buffs that give you versatility or critical strike when you're above 80% hp. They are decent choices for mythic+, depending on the uptime you can get. They're similiar to the Blue Silken Lining embellishment from Dragonflight. If you go for this choice, you should aim to craft them on two low stat budget slots, notably the cloak, wrist or belt slots.

Remember that you will acquire an enchanted heroic crest early in the season as a quest reward, allowing you to craft a 619 item without spending any of your crests.

## Trinkets



# FAQ

### Why can't I enter Solar Eclipse?

- Because you are talented into !Lunar Calling!.

### How can I proc !Waning Twilight! without !Wild Mushroom! or !Stellar Flare!?

- With !Astral Smolder!.

### I've read the priority list and I think my rotation looks correct but I'm still doing very low damage. What could be the reason?

- Log one of your fights and check it with [warcraftlogs](https://articles.warcraftlogs.com/help/how-to-navigate-through-logs) and [wowanalyzer](https://wowanalyzer.com/). The main thing to check is if you're always casting: the timeline should have no downtime and, as close to zero as possible, cancelled casts. Another common issue is incorrectly planning your movement and wasting casts on dots: you should always have enough AP to cover some distance just by using spenders.

### What is Astral damage?

- Astral damage is both Arcane and Nature damage. Effects that buff Nature spells also applies to Astral spells, and effects that buff Arcane spells likewise also applies to Astral spells. For example, Solar Eclipse multiplies the damage of all Nature & Astral spells by 1.15x, and Lunar Eclipse multiplies the damage of all Arcane & Astral spells by 1.15x. If you have both eclipses, Astral spells get 1.15 \* 1.15 = 1.3225x multiplier, while Nature & Arcane spells get 1.15x.

- Mind that class buffs only affect class spells so if a trinket does nature or arcane damage they are not affected by our buffs to these spell schools.

### Do our dots snapshot?

- No, all of our periodic damage (like !Moonfire!, !Sunfire!, !Stellar Flare!) do NOT snapshot, everything is dynamic. That means any dots gain/lose the damage bonus upon entering/leaving the Eclipse that buffs them and whenever any other stat/damage increases are applied/expire.

### Is there a target count where spreading Sunfire or Moonfire is not worth it?

- No, having your DoT effects up increases your damage done to the target. The conditions for spreading Sunfire and Moonfire are tied to how long the target will live, and not how many targets there are.

### How do I sim for M+?

- It is generally recommended that you steer away from simming unrealistic scenarios like "5 target 40 seconds" as they are likely to give skewed results. Balance Druid stats don't really change much depending on target count either, so you will be perfectly fine just using the default "1 target 5 minute patchwerk" options. If your intention is to sim for mythic+, you can use the [MDT Sim WeakAura](https://wago.io/Yya4XBbl-) which allows you to sim dungeon routes. Please keep in mind that ST damage is still a big part of mythic+.

### I'm doing really low damage in Mythic+, what am I doing wrong?

- If you double-checked your rotation and still feel like you're underperforming you could just be playing low keys, together with classes that have very bursty damage profiles. When playing a Balance Druid, mobs need to live long enough for you to actually start doing damage, which is something that doesn't really happen in keys lower than 12+. Consider focusing a bit more on ST or trying another spec, but take into account the fact that DPS isn't everything in a key.

### I've seen a lot of people running build X instead of Y in Mythic+, is X better?

- Try them out and make an informed decision! Most differences between builds are based on variables like target count, comps, combat timer or utility needed.

### I have read through the Compendium and I have some questions that are not outlined in this FAQ?

- If you have any questions, you can go to the [Dreamgrove discord server](https://discord.gg/XaZ3uXJc) and then ask in there. This guide should cover everything you need, but there could always be some things left out or not considered. Remember, you are not guaranteed to receive the answer you would like.

## Cancelaura Macros

### **Cancelling Starlord**

**Cancelling Starlord is entirely optional and is neither a DPS gain nor loss.**

If you want to engage in this entirely optional method without incurring a DPS loss, you should aim to cancel Starlord at any point in an Eclipse window where the buff is currently at less than two seconds, and you are about to use !Starsurge! to prevent overcapping.

```
#showtooltip
/cancelaura Starlord
```

## Useful WeakAuras and Other Profiles

### **Balance WeakAura Packs**

The following links lead to various Balance Druid WeakAura packs. These contain everything that's recommended to track to play at a high level. None of these are particular better or more useful than others, and which one you should use is up to your personal preference.

- [Shrom's Ultimate AP Bar](https://wago.io/GzpP7i8ic)
- [Oi Balance pack](https://wago.io/OiBalance)
- [LuckyOneUI Druid](https://wago.io/LuckyoneUI-Druid)
- [Afenar The War Within](https://wago.io/HkrSdHFMG)
- [Shrom's AP Bar - Standalone](https://wago.io/J5V9sTM0F)

### Jundies Plater Profile

[This profile for Plater](https://wago.io/ak3iS95aa) is among the most used and asked about public nameplate profiles for Moonkins, having customized colors for each NPC identity. 

### **Regrowth Tracker for Blooming Infusion**

[This weakaura](https://wago.io/BloomingInfusion) tracks your number of casts of Regrowth before you get the Blooming Infusion buff that increases the damage of your next Wrath/Starfire and makes them instant cast, and also tracks your number of Starsurge casts before you proc an instant Regrowth.

### **Casts until you can cast Starfire**

[Starfire Alerter](https://wago.io/rrtAyRQjF):
See the description of the WA for more details. This is not a required WA but will make it easier to not get into situations where you are wasting a Starfire cast inside Solar Eclipse.
