## Corruption/Visions Helmet Enchant

Recommend using [Greater Echoing Void](https://www.wowhead.com/item=238680/greater-rune-of-echoing-void) in all content. You can alternatively play [Greater Void Ritual](https://www.wowhead.com/item=239095/greater-rune-of-the-void-ritual) in mythic plus if you value AoE damage more than Single Target. Note that you can't easily swap these.

## Puzzling Cartel Chips

This list is the same regardless of if you do keys or raid. Always sim yourself for the best results as the list order *can* change due to gear. List is in approximate order of strength not the order you buy the dinar

1. Mythic [Jastors](https://www.wowhead.com/item=231265/the-jastor-diamond?bonus=1533) (if no jastor)
2. Heroic [Jastors](https://www.wowhead.com/item=231265/the-jastor-diamond?bonus=1520) (if no jastor but wont kill mythic gally, or for temp dps if you will and think you need it/spare dinar)
3. Mythic [Best-in-Slots](https://www.wowhead.com/item=232526/best-in-slots?bonus=1533)
4. Mythic [House of Cards](https://www.wowhead.com/item=230027/house-of-cards?bonus=1533&class=11&spec=103) (if no mythic Signet of the priory)
5. Mythic [Pacemaker](https://www.wowhead.com/item=232541/improvised-seaforium-pacemaker?bonus=1520&class=11&spec=103)
6. Mythic [Signet of the Priory](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=219308/signet-of-the-priory?class=11&ilvl=684&spec=103) (if you won't kill Mythic OAB)
7. Mythic [Jastors](https://www.wowhead.com/item=231265/the-jastor-diamond?bonus=1533)
8. Mythic [Eye of Kezan](https://www.wowhead.com/item=230198/eye-of-kezan?bonus=1533) (situationally good on mythic gally, or in certain dungeons if you know you'll have high uptime on stacks)

If you still have leftover dinar at this point buy whatever you want. For example, [Greasemonkey's Shift-Stick](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228892/greasemonkeys-shift-stick?bonus=1533&class=11&spec=103) if you can't acquire a myth track weapon. Some really good offspec items:

Resto: [Mr. Pickmeup](https://www.wowhead.com/item=230186/mister-pick-me-up?bonus=1533)

Balance: [Mugs Moxie Jug](https://www.wowhead.com/item=230192/mugs-moxie-jug?bonus=1533)

Guardian: [Chromebustible Bomb Suit](https://www.wowhead.com/item=230029/chromebustible-bomb-suit?bonus=1533) (defensive)/[Tome of Lights Devotion](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219309/tome-of-lights-devotion?ilvl=684) (damage)

<Collapsible title="Advanced Single Target Priority">

**What is a priority list?**

When reading the priority lists below, you should not think about these as steps to follow in a specific order. At any given point in combat, you should cast the first thing in the list that you are able to cast.

The way this section is written is very formulaic and has the same structure as the Action Priority List (APL) used in sims.

**Pre-Combat:**
1. !Bear Form! incredibly minor dps gain for the opener, you can just sit in !Bear Form! until about to pull, and then use !Prowl! to instantly shift into !Cat Form!.
2. !Prowl!
3. !Rake! from stealth.

**Select which talents you have to filter the priority list:**

> [!TIP]
> Uncheck !Bloodtalons! if you want a simpler builder priority.

**Single Target Priority List:**

<details open>
<summary>Highest Priority: Cooldowns</summary>

1. !5217|Tiger's Fury! at 5 combo points or if you're missing 35+ energy, whichever happens first.
2. [*Apex Predator's Craving&&Bloodtalons] !Ferocious Bite! with !Apex Predator's Craving! procs if it won't disrupt procing !Bloodtalons!.
3. [*Apex Predator's Craving&&~Bloodtalons] !Ferocious Bite! with !Apex Predator's Craving! procs.
4. [*Adaptive Swarm] !Adaptive Swarm! when:

    2. There isn't an !Adaptive Swarm! heading to your target, AND
    3. !Adaptive Swarm! is either missing or about to expire with 1/2 stacks. For example, with 3 stacks, you would refresh as soon as !Adaptive Swarm! falls off.
5. [*Unbridled Swarm] !Adaptive Swarm! conditions change based on the amount of !391888|Adaptive Swarms! you have out:
    - If you have 3 !391888|Adaptive Swarms! with at least 2 stacks out, then you will target allies with priority 1 stack > 0 stack > 2 stacks.
    - If you have 2 or fewer !391888|Adaptive Swarms! of at least 2 stacks, cast on your enemy target when swarm is not on them, and is not traveling towards them.
6. [*Incarnation] !102543|Incarnation! with !5217|Tiger's Fury!.
7. [*~Incarnation] !Berserk! with !5217|Tiger's Fury!. You can hold this for !391528|Convoke! if for whatever reason they are misaligned, and you won't lose a cast doing so.
8. [*Feral Frenzy&&Incarnation] !Feral Frenzy! with 1 or no combo points. 2 combo points is also acceptable during !102543|Incarn!.
8. [*Feral Frenzy&&~Incarnation] !Feral Frenzy! with 1 or no combo points. 2 combo points is also acceptable during !Berserk!.

    - You have 2 or fewer combo points outside !Berserk! or 3 or fewer inside !Berserk!.
10. [*Convoke the Spirits] You may also !391528|Convoke! if the fight is about to end. Usually you want to !391528|Convoke! with !Berserk! if you can do so without losing a cast.

# Talents

## Class Tree (all pve content)

![Class Tree Talents](/static/images/FERALCLASS.png)

### Talent Explanations

<details>
<summary>Purple Choice Options Explained</summary> 

!Lore of the Grove!: If you talent !Lunar Inspiration!, you should be talenting this as well.

!Remove Corruption!: Always take if you need poison or curse dispel, which is not every dungeon, and isn't all that common in raid either.

!Nurturing Instinct!: You put points into this if you are playing !Lunar Inspiration! (or technically !391528|Convoke!) and have nothing else to put points in. It is an extremely minor dps increase.

!Feline Swiftness!: You only drop this if you need another talent point to play something else, and value the !Well-Honed Instincts! proc over movement speed

!Well-Honed Instincts!: Strong versus rot damage in particular, its main issue is that sometimes this will trigger when you don't need it to, and because of that it is less reliable.

!1213597|Perfectly-Honed Instincts!: Can take if there isn't anything else you want, or if the fight timers suit 90s cooldown better.

!Incapacitating Roar!: Often picked in keys as a soft-kick. Recently buffed so it won't break instantly. In raid this is pretty niche.

!Ursine Vigor!: Mostly keys only talent for when you need a stronger !Bear Form!. Occasional use in raid as well.

!Fluid Form!: Highly recommended talent to reduce global wastage from shapeshifting. If you don't find yourself shapeshifting much, this talent is much less valuable.

!Typhoon!: If you need a knock, or think the knock will be more useful than !Ursol's Vortex!

!Ursol's Vortex!: Excellent kiting tool that wont leave mobs spread out all over the place. Can also pair with !Typhoon! as a poor mans mass grip, or just to use typhoon as a soft-kick without splaying the mobs all over the place.

!Mass Entanglement!: More of a niche option compared to !Ursol's Vortex!, !Mass Entanglement! can be good if you want to root a group of mobs that the group does not intend to attack. 

!Innervate!: If your healer told you to talent this. Well that or you want !Nature's Vigil! and/or !Forestwalk!.

!Nature's Vigil!: Solid healing during your cooldown windows, especially in keys. Pair this with !Berserk! a vast majority of the time. I would pick this a vast majority of the time with the Class Tree rework.

!Forestwalk!: Decent survivability bump, given that you're receiving healing. Stacks multiplicatively with other healing increases.

!Improved Stampeding Roar!: Great in keys/world content for a more frequent movement cooldown between pulls; also frequently played in raids when you need !Stampeding Roar! more often than every 2 minutes.

!474728|Lycara's Meditation!: If you have the points to spare and you will be shapeshifting a decent amount, this is just more damage. It is best in keys, where you often enter !Bear Form!.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Niche Options Explained</summary> 

!Matted Fur!: If you have nowhere else to put your talent points, this technically does something. It's extremely weak, but technically a defensive increase.

!Heart of the Wild!: For cutting-edge levels of keys where you either need a stronger !Bear Form! to cover damage events, or just another charge of !Frenzied Regeneration!.

!Hibernate!: Almost exclusively used in keys, and rarely so. This is essentially a sap that only works on beasts and dragonkin, essentially you only chose this talent if you have a specific target to hibernate in mind. 

!Mighty Bash!: If you don't need !Incapacitating Roar! but do need a single-target stun, and can afford to take this instead of !Maim!. In PvE, !Mighty Bash! is generally preferred over !Maim! because it doesn't cost combo points and energy to cast, and is niche enough that the cooldown difference isn't as relevant.

!Maim!: In PvE, maim is generally used as an emergency soft-kick as opposed to a stun, though you can use it that way as well. It has a short cooldown, and easy to acquire. Its main issue is how much dps you lose by casting it, relegating the spell to niche-tier. It also puts mobs on stun dr, which in some groups can be inefficient.

!Starfire! -> !Moonkin Form!: This is almost exclusively for access to !Moonkin Form!'s !Wild Charge! for when you cannot !Wild Charge! inside !Travel Form!. In world content, !Flap! can be nice to have as well.

!Astral Influence!: Probably the most niche talent option there is for Feral Druids, this extends the range of !Adaptive Swarm! and !Lunar Inspiration! for when 40 yards isn't enough but 45 yards is.

!Gale Winds!: If you have the talent point to spare, !Gale Winds! makes !Typhoon!ing mobs easier when mobs are spread out.

!Incessant Tempest!: If you find yourself in a scenario where you need to knock twice in less than 30 seconds, this talent lets you do that.

## Raid Talents

Our recommended default hero-tree for raiding is Wildstalker once you acquire at least the 2 piece 11.1 set bonus. That being said, Druid of the Claw may see some play on fights with AoE.

## Dungeon Talents

Feral goes into 11.1 with plenty of options yet again when it comes to M+, with both Hero trees creating two distinct options on their own. Embrace these options and find what works for you, there is simply no 'best' build, especially because different talents will suit different dungeons and groups. However, listed below are some reference builds you can play around with, and the images below can help guide you to customise these builds to your liking.

That being said, Druid of the Claw is the better hero-tree for M+. Not that you can't play Wildstalker if you want to, it is just worse.

### Talent Explanations

<details>
<summary>Section 1 Options Explained</summary> 

!383352|Tireless Energy!: Less single target than !231063|Merciless Claws! but equivalently more AoE damage as well.

!391700|Double-Clawed Rake!: Strong AoE only talent. Only reason its a choice is because this provides zero single-target value. Gains value with Wildstalker.

!231063|Merciless Claws!: This represents the most single target, the least AoE, and the most burst of the three options due to its synergy with !384668|Berserk: Frenzy!. Gains value with Druid of the Claw.

!405300|Thrashing Claws!: decent option if running Lunar Inspiration, frees up more globals to Moonfire more. Video guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IwnGdWeD-k). 

</details>

<details>
<summary>Section 2 Options Explained</summary> 

!384665|Taste for Blood!: Strong single-target and funnel (if a particular dungeon has priority mobs you want to funnel Apex procs into). Strong synergy with !391528|Convoke!, and particularly Druid of the Claw in general. For Wildstalker this talent loses value as bite just isn't much of your damage. Usually if you want more single target, you would rather play !155580|Lunar Inspiration! instead.

!48484|Infected Wounds!: Solid all-rounder talent, particularly good if playing !391700|Double-Clawed Rake! and Wildstalker in general. Still solid as Druid of the Claw, though if you don't talent !384665|Taste for Blood!, then !449645|Savage Fury! is often favored due to burst whilst providing similar overall value.

!384667|Sudden Ambush!: Like !48484|Infected Wounds! this is a solid all-rounder talent with synergy to !391700|Double-Clawed Rake!. It's almost always preferred over !449645|Savage Fury! though, but can rarely be dropped in dungeons with significant AoE, allowing !449645|Savage Fury! to shine.

!449645|Savage Fury!: Great burst and great for larger pull sizes, however a bit less effective on single-target. Longer travel time between packs in some dungeons can give time for TF to reset, thereby giving talents like this higher overall uptime as well. Also of note, one of the m+ affixes this season gives cooldown reduction, which this talent greatly benefits from.

!155580|Lunar Inspiration!: strong single-target and low target cleave as Wildstalker, and can help proc !Bloodtalons! more often.

!236068|Moment of Clarity!: Fairly strong single-target and an excellent all-rounder, can help if you are struggling with energy too. Unlike !384665|Taste for Blood! however, it's single target strength does not extend to funnel damage. 

!391078|Raging Fury! vs !391872|Tiger's Tenacity!: both are good for both Hero trees, Tiger's Tenacity is generally a bit better overall, particularly with DOT-focused builds, but Raging Fury is competitive and the added uptime can be useful depending on how long packs are living, or if you simply prefer playing with a higher uptime on !5217|Tiger's Fury!.

!391078|Raging Fury!/!391872|Tiger's Tenacity! cont.: You can technically drop this node, if and only if you're playing 2x !Carnivorous Instinct! anyway as Druid of the Claw. This nets a small gain in Single Target in exchange for a small loss in AoE. I find this an odd trade-off if you're full sending !Carnivorous Instinct! though, so marked not playing this as niche.

!Brutal Slash! vs !390864|Wild Slashes!: !Brutal Slash! is always better, largely due to it being a relevant dps gain in Single Target, unlike !390864|Wild Slashes!. That being said, !390864|Wild Slashes! has a straightforward way of playing, and is decent enough to comment on. Do NOT pair !390864|Wild Slashes! with !391700|Double-Clawed Rake!, these talents are anti-synergistic.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Section 3 Options Explained</summary> 

!319439|Bloodtalons! vs !391972|Lion's Strength!: I would almost always play !319439|Bloodtalons!. Optimizing !319439|Bloodtalons! is a very small gain in single target, so even as a new player you will see ~2% more damage there. In AoE, the talents are much closer in overall value, and !Lion's Strength! even wins in burst AoE, so in that regard you can justify !Lion's Strength!, especially since it is easier to play. 

!391888|Adaptive Swarm!: Good for both Hero trees, with the first point being one of the single best options you can take for pure single-target, and I would recommend running it almost all the time as Wildstalker. 2 points into !391951|Unbridled! 'beekeeping' is where it gets really interesting if you want more cleave and AOE value, particularly on medium size pulls. However its value drops off on really large AOE.

!390902|Carnivorous Instinct!: Excellent burst option, with particular strength in large AOE, and it's one of the only talents in the bottom section that buffs Brutal Slash for example, which is stronger inside of !343223|Berserk!. Gains more value if playing !391078|Raging Fury!.

!274837|Feral Frenzy!: Solid single-target/prio option for both Hero trees, and decent in AOE as well, as it can help you weave !Ferocious Bite! with the free combo points. Generally taken if you want more single-target, but already have !391888|Adaptive Swarm! talented.

!391347|Rip & Tear! vs !391978|Veinripper!: !391347|Rip & Tear! offers more overall damage, though Veinripper nets more priority damage.

!421432|Saber Jaws!: A pure single-target option for Druid of the Claw, its value will vary significantly based on dungeon. Mutually exclusive with the !391347|Rip & Tear! vs !391978|Veinripper! node.

# Consumables

## Potions

[Tempered Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=430599/tempered-potion) is your dps potion for every situation.

[Algari Healing Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/item=211880/algari-healing-potion) is the only health potion available. That being said, if you find yourself equipped with an engineering crafted piece for whatever reason, [Heartseeking Health Injector](https://www.wowhead.com/item=221910/tinker-heartseeking-health-injector) can situationally be a superior option.

## Food

[Feast of the Midnight Masquerade](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222733/feast-of-the-midnight-masquerade), [Feast of the Divine Day](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=445112/feast-of-the-divine-day) and [Beledar's Bounty](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222728/beledars-bounty) are all essentially equal, with [Beledar's Bounty](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222728/beledars-bounty) being by far the cheapest option.

## Phials

[Flask of Alchemical Chaos](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212283/flask-of-alchemical-chaos) for every situation. Rarely, with [Signet of the Priory](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=219308/signet-of-the-priory?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103) and/or [Mechano-Core Amplifier](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=232485/mechano-core-amplifier?class=11&ilvl=665&spec=103), [Flask of Tempered Mastery](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212280/flask-of-tempered-mastery?crafting-quality=6) can be better.

## Weapon Oils/Stones

[Algari Mana Oil](https://www.wowhead.com/item=224107/algari-mana-oil) overtakes other options with 11.1 gear.

## Augment Rune

[Crystallized Augment Rune](https://www.wowhead.com/item=224572/crystallized-augment-rune)

# Gearing

## Stat Priority

> [!WARNING]
> Sim yourself using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). Do not follow any stat priorities.

## Gems and Enchants

| Slot | Gem/Enchant |
|------|---------|
| **Gems** |  1x [Elusive Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213746/elusive-blasphemite) or [Culminating Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213743/culminating-blasphemite) and a mixture of the other gems based on your sims. It is not worth slotting in a Stamina gem. Personally don't think [Elusive Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213746/elusive-blasphemite) is necessary as a Feral Druid, given that we already have a lot of speed, but it would be a disservice to not mention it. |
| **Weapon** | [Authority of the Depths](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223784/enchant-weapon-authority-of-the-depths?crafting-quality=6) is our best pure-single target enchant. Sim your character to see what is best with increased targets. |
| **Chest** | [Crystalline Radiance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223692/enchant-chest-crystalline-radiance) |
| **Cloak** | [Chant of Winged Grace](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223731/enchant-cloak-chant-of-winged-grace) |
| **Legs** | [Stormbound Armor Kit](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219911/stormbound-armor-kit) |
| **Wrist** | [Chant of Armored Avoidance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223713/enchant-bracer-chant-of-armored-avoidance) |
| **Boots** | [Defender's March](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223656/enchant-boots-defenders-march) or [Scout's March](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223653/enchant-boots-scouts-march) |
| **Ring** | You should always sim your own character to determine what enchant to use in this slot. They tend to be very close. If you don't want to sim, [Radiant Mastery](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223677/enchant-ring-radiant-mastery) is usually a safe choice. |

> [!TIP]
> Don't forget to add sockets to your rings and necklaces using [Magnificent Jeweler's Setting](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213777/magnificent-jewelers-setting)!

## Crafting

> [!NOTE]
> The biggest question is whether or not to craft a weapon, or gamble on acquiring a myth track weapon early on. (for example [Greasemonkey's Shift Stick](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228892/greasemonkeys-shift-stick?bonus=4800:4786:1511:11991&class=11&ilvl=662&spec=103) from the first boss of the raid, if you'll enter Mythic quickly.) If you do get one, then skip crafting a weapon.

**Crafting Order:**

- [Charged Halberd](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222448/charged-halberd?bonus=8791&class=11&ilvl=636&spec=103) (or any crafted 2h agi weapon) with [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=226022/darkmoon-sigil-ascension). If you already have a myth track weapon, you can skip this.
- Sim the best slot for your gear using [Writhing Armor Banding](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506/writhing-armor-banding) (if you have weapon with [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=226022/darkmoon-sigil-ascension)) or [Dawnthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222868/dawnthread-lining).
- Can continue doing the above. Ever since the crest requirement for crafted gear got nerfed this route is equally efficient in that regard.

## Trinkets

These trinket lists are in rough order of strength, assuming the highest item level version of the items. You should always sim your own character to determine which trinkets you should equip. 

> [!NOTE]
> This is updated for the recent wave of buffs to trinkets that deal flat damage.

**For use in Raid:**
| Tier | Trinket | Notes |
| :-: | :- | :- |
| **S Tier** | [House of Cards](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=230027/house-of-cards?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103) | 90s on-use trinket. Generally will hold this to pair with Berserk. On some fight timers where you hold Berserk, you can squeeze an extra use of this in between.
|  | [Signet of the Priory](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=219308/signet-of-the-priory?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103) | 2 min on-use trinket. Pair this with Berserk. The value of this trinket is increased slightly if others in your group are running it.
|  | [Improvised Seaforium Pacemaker](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=232541/improvised-seaforium-pacemaker?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103) |
|  | [Eye of Kezan](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=230198/eye-of-kezan?bonus=1527:11996:11964&ilvl=678&spec=103) | The longer the fight, the more this pulls ahead of everything else. The shorter the fight, the more this falls behind. This ranking assumes a ~5minute fight.
| **A Tier** | [Mechano-Core Amplifier](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=232485/mechano-core-amplifier?class=11&ilvl=665&spec=103) | Highly recommend doing your delve bounty/map and filling delve vault for this trinket if you don't have the above on myth track.
|  | [Junkmaestro's Mega Magnet](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=230189/junkmaestros-mega-magnet?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103) | Doesn't matter when you use this for pure damage, just dont cap stacks and don't gimp other trinket cooldowns for it.
|  | [Suspicious Energy Drink](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=235363/suspicious-energy-drink?bonus=1537:11992:11964&class=11&ilvl=665&spec=103) |
|  | [Zee's Thug Hotline](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=230199/zees-thug-hotline?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103) | This trinket is incredibly good during lust. Enough so that, in very short fights (sub 2 min), it is likely our best option.
|  | [Reverb Radio](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=230194/reverb-radio?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103) |
|  | [Azerokk's Resonating Heart](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=159612/azerokks-resonating-heart?ilvl=678&spec=103) |
|  | [Geargrinder's Spare Keys](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=230197/geargrinders-spare-keys?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103) | Value decreases a bit with a stat on-use equipped.

**For use in Mythic+:**
| Tier | Trinket | Notes |
| :-: | :- | :- |
| **S Tier** | [House of Cards](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=230027/house-of-cards?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103) | 90s on-use trinket. Pair with Berserk
| | [Signet of the Priory](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=219308/signet-of-the-priory?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103) | Pair with Berserk.
| **A Tier** | [Eye of Kezan: High Combat Uptime](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=230198/eye-of-kezan?bonus=1527:11996:11964&ilvl=678&spec=103) | Superb as long as you can maintain a high amount of average stacks.
| | [Mechano-Core Amplifier](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=232485/mechano-core-amplifier?class=11&ilvl=665&spec=103) |
| | [Suspicious Energy Drink](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=235363/suspicious-energy-drink?bonus=1537:11992:11964&class=11&ilvl=665&spec=103) |
| | [Improvised Seaforium Pacemaker](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=232541/improvised-seaforium-pacemaker?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103) | This loses value relative to raid because the timers don't align as nicely in a dungeon environment. If you're consistently getting this buff for your cooldowns then its value goes up.
| **B Tier** | [Azerokk's Resonating Heart](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=159612/azerokks-resonating-heart?ilvl=678&spec=103) |
| | [Reverb Radio](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=230194/reverb-radio?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103) |
| | [Junkmaestro's Mega Magnet](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=230189/junkmaestros-mega-magnet?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103) | |
| | [Geargrinder's Spare Keys](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=230197/geargrinders-spare-keys?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103) | moves up slightly if your other trinket is not an on-use |

> [!WARNING]
> [Eye of Kezan](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=230198/eye-of-kezan?bonus=1527:11996:11964&ilvl=678&spec=103) is extremely dungeon and group dependent. I would recommend not playing this, unless you are confident in acquiring high combat uptime.

### Trinket FAQ

Q: How do I use stat on-use trinkets with [Best-in-Slots](https://www.wowhead.com/item=232526/best-in-slots?bonus=1527) equipped?

A: You send your trinket with cooldowns, and then use [Best-in-Slots](https://www.wowhead.com/item=232526/best-in-slots?bonus=1527) with your next !Tiger's Fury! (with !Convoke the Spirits! instead if you are running !Ashamane's Guidance!)

Q: Should we be playing double on-use with [Signet of the Priory](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=219308/signet-of-the-priory?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103) and [House of Cards](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=230027/house-of-cards?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103)?

A: No, usually we only play 1 on-use trinket. Though you should always sim just in case.

Q: How many buffs does [Signet of the Priory](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=219308/signet-of-the-priory?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103) assume?

A: By default, none. You can add the buffs yourself by pasting `thewarwithin.signet_of_the_priory_party_stats=crit/haste/mastery/versatility` into the Custom APL box of your sim. Remove whatever ally stat you dont want to sim.

Q: [Mechano-Core Amplifier](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=232485/mechano-core-amplifier?class=11&ilvl=665&spec=103)/[Suspicious Energy Drink](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=235363/suspicious-energy-drink?bonus=1537:11992:11964&class=11&ilvl=665&spec=103) is simming better than some of the higher item level stuff on this list for me, should I use it?

A: Absolutely. These trinkets are particularly potent for their item level.

Q: Why do damaging trinkets deal more damage as Wildstalker?

A: The Wildstalker Hero Talent !440119|Vigorous Creepers! buffs non-feral damage as well, including damage from trinkets.

## Cyrce's Circlet

Yes we are still going to play this ring in 11.1, and it will be our best-in-slot. This is true even when myth track item level increases by 6. That being said, some people may find that other items outsim this ring in their current gear.

### Recommended Citrines

Thunder Citrine: Always play [Stormbringer's Runed Citrine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228638/stormbringers-runed-citrine).

Sea Citrine: Always play [Fathomdweller's Runed Citrine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228639/fathomdwellers-runed-citrine).

Wind Citrine: Always play [Windsinger's Runed Citrine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228640/windsingers-runed-citrine).

# Miscellaneous

## What is snapshotting?

Snapshotting refers to the process of continually ensuring that your strongest bleeds are ticking on your targets. The strength of feral bleed ticks is snapshotted (calculated) at the moment of application and lasts for the duration of the bleed. If certain buffs are active when the bleed is applied, such as !5217|Tiger's Fury!, its snapshot will be stronger.

Tracking the strength of different bleeds manually requires a lot of mental-overhead, so we recommend the use of Weak Aura bleed packages such as those found [here](#useful-weakauras-and-addons). All of our WA packages follow the same general format:
* If the bleed's icon is highlighted in green or its number is higher than 100: applying now results in a stronger bleed than the one you currently have active.
* If the bleed's icon is highlighted in grey or its number is equal to 100: equal value bleed
* If the bleed's icon is highlighted in red or its number is lower than 100: applying now results in a weaker bleed than the one you currently have active.

Note: You will not necessarily upgrade every snapshot. Please review the rotation section.

__Which bleeds snapshot which buffs?__

| DoT | !Tiger's Fury! | !Pouncing Strikes! | !Bloodtalons! | !Moment of Clarity! |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| !Rake! | 	✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| !Thrash! | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| !Rip! | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| !Primal Wrath! | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| !Lunar Inspiration! | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| !Adaptive Swarm! | First Jump Only | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| !Dreadful Wound! | Upgrades and extends | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

> [!TIP]
> !Pouncing Strikes! can be applied via !58984|Shadowmeld!/!Prowl!/!Sudden Ambush!

A dot will ideally be applied only when 30% or less of the prior dot remains. This triggers a mechanic known as “pandemic,” which is common to most damage over time spells.

## What is “pandemic range?”
This term refers to a DoT mechanic in WoW. The baseline duration of a DoT can be extended by up to 30% if a target is already affected by that DoT. Due to the 30% cap on extension, DoTs generally shouldn't be refreshed too early, as potential ticks will be lost. The ideal window of time to refresh a DoT is known as its “pandemic range.”

Let’s use an example. Consider a 10 second DoT:
* Refresh with 1s remaining: the new DoT will be 11s long (10s baseline duration + 1s from prior DoT)
* Refresh with 3s remaining: the new DoT will be 13s long (10s baseline duration + 3s from prior DoT)
* Refresh with 8s remaining: the new DoT will still be 13s long (10s baseline + up to 30% from prior DoT)

It is therefore most efficient to wait until 70% or more of your bleed has ticked to refresh its DoT.

Fun trivia: the name “pandemic” derives from an old warlock passive that was eventually integrated as a baseline feature of damage over time spells.

__What is “clipping?”__

Clipping refers to refreshing a dot prior to its pandemic window. Sometimes you will want to do this with Feral because of snapshotting and/or !Bloodtalons!.

## Macros

Here, we provide a list of helpful macros. These macros are not required, but may be of use to you. Customize them as you see fit.

**Cast Ursol's Vortex at your cursor location (@cursor macro):**

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@cursor] Ursol's Vortex
```

**Use your trinket(s) and/or weapon at the same time as an ability:**

Some trinkets and weapons should be used with a major cooldown. A lot of players will bind these items with Berserk.
* 13 is the top trinket slot
* 14 is the bottom trinket slot
* 16 is your weapon slot

If you would like to use all three items with Berserk, use this macro:

```
#showtooltip
/use 13
/use 14
/use 16
/cast Berserk
```
This macro may be modified. For example, the macro below only uses the 2nd trinket with Berserk:

```
#showtooltip
/use 14
/cast Berserk
```

**Cast Entangling Roots on your mouseover target:**

This macro casts Entangling Roots on your mouseover target. If your mouse is not hovering over a target, the macro instead casts Entangling Roots on your current target.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, harm, nodead] [] Entangling Roots
```

**Dispel/Soothe on the same bind:**

This is the classic help/harm macro, but using mouseovers as well.

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, harm, nodead] Soothe; [@mouseover, help, nodead] Remove Corruption; [harm, nodead] Soothe; Remove Corruption
```

**Skull Bash your Focus target:**

This macro casts Skull Bash on your focus target. If you have not set a focus target, the macro instead casts Skull Bash on your current target.

We recommend creating a keybind that will assign a target as your focus with one click. This option can be found in the game's keybind settings.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@focus, harm, nodead] [] skull bash
```

**Cast Adaptive Swarm on your ally or enemy mouseover target:**

This macro casts Adaptive Swarm on a friendly mouseover target. If your mouse is not hovering over a target, the macro instead casts Adaptive Swarm on your current target.

Many abilities that are cast on allies - Rejuvenation, Regrowth, Innervate, etc - may be macro'd in this fashion. To make those macros, simply replace the term "Adaptive Swarm" with your spell of choice.
If you want mouseover to work for both friendly and enemy targets, replace 'help' with 'exists'. If you want it to only work on enemy targets, replace 'help' with 'harm'.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, help, nodead] [] Adaptive Swarm
```

**Cast Rebirth on an ally:**

This macro casts Rebirth on your current friendly but dead mouseover target. If your ally is alive, the macro instead casts Mark of the Wild.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, help, dead] Rebirth; Mark of the Wild
```

**Why does my mouseover macro not work?**

You probably have it bound to a mouse button, which doesn't allow mouseover macros by default. To fix this, you can use an addon like Clicked, or just map the mouse-button to a different key. Backtick (`)/Tilde (~) can also have this issue. If you don't have it bound to a mouse-button and it still doesn't work, then there is likely an issue with the macro itself. In this case, it's almost always the ommission of help, harm or exists in the brackets containing mouseover.

## Useful WeakAura(s) and Addons

### **Full WeakAura Packages for Feral**
To play feral competently, many variables must be tracked. A single WeakAura is not up to this task, so our contributors have spent many hours assembling full WA packages from individual WeakAuras.

Each package contains multiple WeakAuras that work with each other to help you understand what's happening in combat. No package is superior to the others in the list. We recommend you try out several, and settle on your favorite.
