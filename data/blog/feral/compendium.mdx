# News

Feral Druid in 11.2 is mostly just more of the same. The various buffs we have received have no gameplay impact. That being said, the removal of 11.1 tier set means !Apex Predator's Craving! is no longer mandatory in raid.

This go-around, Tier Set bonuses are based on which hero tree you have selected. Once you acquire 2 pieces, Druid of the Claw will be the hero talent of choice for all PvE Content.

## Druid of the Claw Tier Set


2 Set: 

>Ravage increases your haste by 10%, chance to critically strike by 10%, and the damage your bleeds deal by 30% for 5 sec.

4 Set:

>Ravage has a 40% chance to make you Ravage your target again 4 sec later at 100% of the initial power.


2p2p results in a ~8.9% gain in single target over old 4p, switching the point from !Apex Predator's Craving! to !Carnivorous Instinct!. Getting the full 4p nets a ~14.6% gain in single target. 

## Wildstalker Tier Set


2 Set:

>The rate at which Bloodseeker Vines grow is increased by 40%. Tiger's Fury causes Bloodseeker Vines to grow on up to 3 valid nearby enemies.

4 Set:

>Bloodseeker Vines have a 20% chance to trigger Bursting Growth every 2 sec at 100% effectiveness. Each stack of Bloodseeker Vines on an enemy increases Bursting Growth damage taken by 30%.


Going to 2p2p results in a ~6% gain in single target, and switches your build off of !Apex Predator's Craving! back to the L-Build we played in season 1. Gaining the 4p bonus leads to roughly an 11.4% gain in single target, putting it behind Druid of the Claw even in single target.

# Rotation

> [!CAUTION]
> For Druid of the Claw, replace the moonfire cast with a !Thrash! instead. These graphics will eventually be replaced with something else.

<Collapsible title="Advanced Single Target Priority">

**What is a priority list?**

When reading the priority lists below, you should not think about these as steps to follow in a specific order. At any given point in combat, you should cast the first thing in the list that you are able to cast.

The way this section is written is very formulaic and has the same structure as the Action Priority List (APL) used in sims.

**Pre-Combat:**

1. [*Unbridled Swarm] Stack as many !Adaptive Swarm!s on allies as you can prepull.
2. !Prowl!
3. !Rake! from stealth.

**Select which talents you have to filter the priority list:**

> [!TIP]
> Uncheck !Bloodtalons! if you want a simpler builder priority.

### Class Talent Explanations

<details>
<summary>Optional Nodes Explained</summary> 

!Lore of the Grove!: If you talent !Lunar Inspiration!, you should be talenting this as well.

!Remove Corruption!: Always take if you need poison or curse dispel, which is not every dungeon, and isn't all that common in raid either.

!Maim!: In dungeons, if you don't take !Remove Corruption!, this is the standard alternative.

!Nurturing Instinct!: You put points into this if you are playing !Lunar Inspiration! (or technically !391528|Convoke!) and have nothing else to put points in. It is an extremely minor dps increase.

!Feline Swiftness!: You only drop this if you need another talent point to play something else.

!1213597|Perfectly-Honed Instincts!: Can take if there isn't anything else you want, or if the fight timers suit 90s defensive cooldowns better.

!Incapacitating Roar!: Often picked in keys as a soft aoe-kick. In raid this is pretty niche.

!Ursine Vigor!: Mostly keys-only talent for when you need a stronger !Bear Form!. Niche use in Raid.

!Fluid Form!: Highly recommended talent to reduce global wastage from shapeshifting. If you don't find yourself shapeshifting much, this talent is much less valuable.

!Typhoon!: If you need a knock, or think the knock will be more useful than !Ursol's Vortex!

!Ursol's Vortex!: Excellent kiting tool that wont leave mobs spread out all over the place. Can also pair with !Typhoon! as a poor mans mass grip, or just to use typhoon as a soft-kick without splaying the mobs all over the place.

!Mass Entanglement!: More of a niche option compared to !Ursol's Vortex!, !Mass Entanglement! can be good if you want to root a group of mobs that the group does not intend to attack. 

!Innervate!: If your healer told you to talent this. Well that or you want !Nature's Vigil! and/or !Forestwalk!.

!Nature's Vigil!: Strong healing during your cooldown windows, particularly in keys. Pair this with !Berserk! a vast majority of the time.

!Forestwalk!: Decent survivability bump, given that you're receiving healing and pressing Regrowth, particularly against rot.

!Improved Stampeding Roar!: For when you want to !Stampeding Roar! more often than its 2 minute cooldown allows.

!474728|Lycara's Inspiration!: A bit more stamina never hurt anyone.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Niche Options Explained</summary> 

!Heart of the Wild!: For cutting-edge levels of keys where you either need a stronger !Bear Form! to cover damage events, or just another charge of !Frenzied Regeneration!

!Hibernate!: Almost exclusively used in keys, and rarely so. This is essentially a sap that only works on beasts and dragonkin, essentially you only chose this talent if you have a specific target to hibernate in mind. 

!Mighty Bash!: If you don't need !Incapacitating Roar! but do need a single-target stun, and can afford to take this instead of !Maim!. In PvE, !Mighty Bash! is generally preferred over !Maim! because it doesn't cost combo points and energy to cast, and is niche enough that the cooldown difference isn't as relevant.

!Starfire! -> !Moonkin Form!: This is exclusively for access to !Moonkin Form!'s !Wild Charge! for when you cannot !Wild Charge! inside !Travel Form!. Often combined with !Flap! for more distance.

!Gale Winds!: If you have the talent point to spare, !Gale Winds! makes !Typhoon!ing mobs easier when mobs are spread out.

!Incessant Tempest!: If you find yourself in a scenario where you need to knock twice in less than 30 seconds, this talent lets you do that.

## Raid Talents

Wildstalker and Druid of the Claw are similar in strength once you acquire 2 pieces of the new tier set-- with DOTC being less than 1% ahead in single target, varying a bit depending on gear. This means you could play either hero tree and perform well. 

So, how do you choose? Druid of the Claw is swingier, and thus has a higher capacity for high-rolling. It sims higher in single target, and its also stronger in AoE-- given that you can take advantage of its Berserk windows. 

Wildstalker, on the other hand, gets more passive cleave in its full single-target build than Druid of the Claw does, and is more consistent (Lower potential for underperforming). Its AoE potency in cooldowns does not hold up to scrutiny however, especially in a raid environment where you can't properly set up your dots/vines. Lastly, Wildstalker manages forced downtime better than Druid of the Claw, particularly on fights where you can talent !Lunar Inspiration!.

That being said, you should think of Druid of the Claw as the default tree for all PvE content.

## Dungeon Talents

Feral goes into 11.2 with much of the same talent choices as last season. Most notably, Wildstalker is more competitive in this game mode than ever before, though admittedly still a bit lacking relative to DOTC.

### Talent Explanations

!Root Network! for Wildstalker is playable for large-aoe dungeons; I would default to !Resilient Flourishing!.

<details>
<summary>Section 1 Options Explained</summary> 

!383352|Tireless Energy!: Less single target than !231063|Merciless Claws! but equivalently more AoE damage as well. Highly recommend at least the first point.

!391700|Double-Clawed Rake!: Strong AoE only talent. Only reason its a choice is because this provides zero single-target value. Gains value with Wildstalker-- enough so to make it required (in my opinion)

!231063|Merciless Claws!: This represents the most single target, the least AoE, and the most burst of the three options (excluding the 1st point of !Tireless Energy!) due to its synergy with !384668|Berserk: Frenzy!. Gains value with Druid of the Claw.

!405300|Thrashing Claws!: Niche option if running Lunar Inspiration, frees up more globals to Moonfire. Video guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IwnGdWeD-k). 

</details>

<details>
<summary>Section 2 Options Explained</summary> 

!391078|Raging Fury! vs !391872|Tiger's Tenacity!: Both are good for Druid of the Claw-- though !Raging Fury! is a niche pick for more AoE when you talent into x2 !Carnivorous Instinct!. Tiger's Tenacity is otherwise locked in.

!384667|Sudden Ambush!: This is a solid all-rounder talent with synergy to !391700|Double-Clawed Rake!. It's almost always preferred over !449645|Savage Fury! though, but can rarely be dropped in dungeons with significant AoE, allowing !449645|Savage Fury! to shine. Most notably Priory.

!449645|Savage Fury!: Great burst and great for larger pull sizes, however a bit less effective on single-target in comparison to !Sudden Ambush!. Longer travel time between packs in some dungeons can give time for TF to reset, thereby giving talents like this higher overall uptime as well. Also of note, one of the m+ affixes this season gives cooldown reduction, which this talent greatly benefits from.

!236068|Moment of Clarity!: Fairly strong single-target and an excellent all-rounder, can help if you are struggling with energy too. Niche for Druid of the Claw as your points in the middle-section are pretty locked, likely replacing the last point in the bottom section if at all.

!155580|Lunar Inspiration!: strong single-target and low target cleave as Wildstalker, and can help proc !Bloodtalons! more often. Unplayable as Druid of the Claw.

!Brutal Slash! vs !390864|Wild Slashes!: !Brutal Slash! is always better, largely due to it being a relevant dps gain in Single Target, unlike !390864|Wild Slashes!. That being said, !390864|Wild Slashes! has a straightforward way of playing, and is decent enough to comment on. Do NOT pair !390864|Wild Slashes! with !391700|Double-Clawed Rake!, these talents are anti-synergistic.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Section 3 Options Explained</summary>

!Incarnation: Avatar of Ashamane! vs !Convoke the Spirits!:
This option only exists for Druid of the Claw. Essentially, !Incarnation: Avatar of Ashamane! begins surpassing !Convoke the Spirits! at roughly 3-4 targets-- but its a significant single target loss. The idea is you can drop combat on trash packs making use of the in-combat !Prowl!. This generates an additional Ravage via Killing Strikes, netting a large amount of value with the tier set. Essentially, you can play !Incarnation: Avatar of Ashamane! in big AoE keys, particularly if your group is chain pulling and the single target loss is palatable. I wouldn't consider it in lower keys where things die too fast.

!319439|Bloodtalons! vs !391972|Lion's Strength!:
I would always play !319439|Bloodtalons!. Optimizing !319439|Bloodtalons! is a very small gain in single target, so even as a new player you will see ~2% more damage there. In AoE, the talents are much closer in overall value, and !Lion's Strength! even wins in burst AoE, so in that regard you can justify !Lion's Strength!, especially since it is easier to play. 

!391888|Adaptive Swarm!: Great for both Hero trees, being one of the single best options you can take for pure single-target. I would recommend running it all the time as Wildstalker, and most of the time as Druid of the Claw.

!Unbridled Swarm!: Solid single-target with incredible low/mid cleave damage as well. It is partially due to its single-target strength that !Feral Frenzy! has seen a lot less play this expansion.

!390902|Carnivorous Instinct!: Excellent burst option, with particular strength in large AOE. Gains more value if playing !391078|Raging Fury!. The first point is stronger than the second.

!274837|Feral Frenzy!: Solid single-target/prio option for both Hero trees, and okay in AOE as well, as it lets you cast more !Ferocious Bite!s. Only taken if you want more single-target and already have !391888|Adaptive Swarm! talented.

!391347|Rip & Tear! vs !391978|Veinripper!:
!391347|Rip & Tear! offers more overall damage-- enough so that it should be considered the default. Nichely, Veinripper nets more priority damage.

!421432|Saber Jaws!: A pure single-target option for Druid of the Claw, its value will vary significantly based on dungeon. Mutually exclusive with the !391347|Rip & Tear! vs !391978|Veinripper! node. I consider this niche, as if you want more single-target, !Adaptive Swarm! is your choice. If you want more single-target beyond that? Usually !Feral Frenzy!. Its lack of AoE value makes the talent tough, though possible, to justify.

# Consumables

| Type | Consumable |
|------|---------|
| **DPS Potion** | [Tempered Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=430599/tempered-potion)  |
| **Healing Potion** | [Invigorating Healing Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=244835/invigorating-healing-potion) is the best health potion available. |
| **Food** | [Beledar's Bounty](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222728/beledars-bounty) or any other secondary stat food. |
| **Flask** | [Flask of Alchemical Chaos](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212283/flask-of-alchemical-chaos) |

# Gearing

## Stat Priority

> [!WARNING]
> Sim yourself using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). Do not follow any stat priorities.

## Gems and Enchants

| Slot | Gem/Enchant |
|------|---------|
| **Gems** |  1x [Elusive Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213746/elusive-blasphemite) or [Culminating Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213743/culminating-blasphemite) and a mixture of the other gems based on your sims. It is not worth slotting in a Stamina gem. Personally don't think [Elusive Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213746/elusive-blasphemite) is necessary as a Feral Druid, given that we already have a lot of speed, but it would be a disservice to not mention it. |
| **Weapon** | [Authority of the Depths](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223784/enchant-weapon-authority-of-the-depths?crafting-quality=6) begins as our best single-target enchant, with increased gear or increased target count, any of the secondary-stat enchants will overtake. For example, [Stonebound Artistry](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223763/enchant-weapon-stonebound-artistry). |
| **Chest** | [Crystalline Radiance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223692/enchant-chest-crystalline-radiance) |
| **Cloak** | [Chant of Winged Grace](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223731/enchant-cloak-chant-of-winged-grace) |
| **Legs** | [Stormbound Armor Kit](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219911/stormbound-armor-kit) |
| **Wrist** | [Chant of Armored Avoidance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223713/enchant-bracer-chant-of-armored-avoidance) |
| **Boots** | [Defender's March](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223656/enchant-boots-defenders-march) or [Scout's March](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223653/enchant-boots-scouts-march) |
| **Ring** | You should always sim your own character to determine what enchant to use in this slot. They tend to be very close. If you don't want to sim, [Radiant Mastery](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223677/enchant-ring-radiant-mastery) is usually a safe choice. |

> [!TIP]
> Don't forget to add sockets to your rings and necklaces using [Magnificent Jeweler's Setting](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213777/magnificent-jewelers-setting)!

## Crafting

> [!NOTE]
> The biggest question is whether or not to craft a weapon, or gamble on acquiring a myth track weapon early on. (for example [Obliteration Beamglaive](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=237739/obliteration-beamglaive) from the first boss of the raid, if you'll enter Mythic quickly.) If you do get one, then skip crafting a weapon.

**Crafting Order:**

- [Charged Halberd](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222448/charged-halberd?bonus=8791&class=11&ilvl=636&spec=103) (or any crafted 2h agi weapon) with [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=226022/darkmoon-sigil-ascension). If you already have a myth track weapon, you can skip this.
- Sim the best slot for your gear using [Writhing Armor Banding](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506/writhing-armor-banding) (if you have weapon with [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=226022/darkmoon-sigil-ascension)) or [Dawnthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222868/dawnthread-lining)/[Duskthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222873/duskthread-lining)
- Can continue doing the above. Ever since the crest requirement for crafted gear got nerfed this route is equally efficient in that regard.

By the end of the patch, the two embellishment items will be on Wrists and Belt.

## Trinkets

These trinket lists are in rough order of strength, assuming the highest item level version of the items. You should always sim your own character to determine which trinkets you should equip. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Double stat on-use trinkets is generally bad, your second trinket should be a passive.

**On-use trinket ranking**
1. [Araz's Ritual Forge](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=242402/arazs-ritual-forge?bonus=1533:12361:12239&ilvl=723&spec=103)

3. [Signet of the Priory](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219308/signet-of-the-priory?class=11&hero=21&ilvl=723&spec=103)
4. [Lily of the Eternal Weave](https://www.wowhead.com/item=242494/lily-of-the-eternal-weave?bonus=3215:12361:12239&class=11&hero=22&ilvl=723&spec=103&spellModifier=1244029:137011)
5. [Cursed Stone Idol](https://www.wowhead.com/item=246344/cursed-stone-idol?bonus=1595:12361:12239&class=11&hero=22&ilvl=723&spec=103)
6. [Incorporeal Essence Gorger](https://www.wowhead.com/item=246945/incorporeal-essence-gorger?bonus=1572:12357:12239&class=11&hero=22&spec=103)
7. [Observer's Soul Fetters](https://www.wowhead.com/item=240171/observers-soul-fetters?bonus=3207:12285:12239&hero=22&ilvl=678&spec=103)

[Wrathstone](https://www.wowhead.com/item=156000/wrathstone?bonus=11415:12357:12239&hero=22&ilvl=710&spec=103) is also very good, if you happen to have it from Ulduar timewalking. Mainly in Raid.

**For use in Raid:**
| Tier | Trinket | Notes |
| :-: | :- | :- |
| **SS Tier** | [Araz's Ritual Forge](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=242402/arazs-ritual-forge?bonus=1533:12361:12239&ilvl=723&spec=103) | 2 min on-use trinket. Macro to berserk, so strong that even a lower item level version of this can be better than your other options.
| **A Tier** | [Astral Antenna](https://www.wowhead.com/item=242395/astral-antenna?class=11&hero=21&ilvl=723&spec=103) | Passive crit proc. Sometimes you can't get full benefit, reducing its value a bit. Can sim with higher miss chance in Raidbots options.
| **B Tier** | [Improvised Seaforium Pacemaker](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=232541/improvised-seaforium-pacemaker?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103) | Cyclical Crit proc.

| | [Ara'kara Sacbrood](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219314/ara-kara-sacbrood?hero=21&ilvl=723&spec=103) | A little bit worse for DOTC, but still a solid passive trinket.
| | [So'leah's Secret Technique](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=190958/soleahs-secret-technique?bonus=10035:12361:12239&class=11&spec=103) | True stat stick, sim default is mastery. Higher if you factor in ally buff.

**For use in Mythic+:**
| Tier | Trinket | Notes |
| :-: | :- | :- |
| **S Tier** | [Araz's Ritual Forge](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=242402/arazs-ritual-forge?bonus=1533:12361:12239&ilvl=723&spec=103) | Macro to Berserk
| | [Unyielding Netherprism](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=242396/unyielding-netherprism?bonus=1533:12361:12239&ilvl=723&spec=103) | Macro to Berserk, best in large target count dungeons as its proc is true AoE, ideally with not a lot of single-target. Dont die. If you plan to, dont use this trinket.
| **A Tier** | [Astral Antenna](https://www.wowhead.com/item=242395/astral-antenna?class=11&hero=21&ilvl=723&spec=103) |
| **B Tier** | [Empowering Crystal of Anub'ikkaj](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219312/empowering-crystal-of-anubikkaj?class=11&hero=21&ilvl=723&spec=103) |
| | [So'leah's Secret Technique](https://www.wowhead.com/item=185818/soleahs-secret-technique?class=11&hero=21&ilvl=723&spec=103) | Sim which secondary is best, but odds are its mastery. Arguably should be rated higher for consistency + ally benefit.
| | [Cursed Stone Idol](https://www.wowhead.com/item=246344/cursed-stone-idol?bonus=1595:12361:12239&class=11&hero=22&ilvl=723&spec=103) | As a 2nd on-use. Particularly with [Unyielding Netherprism](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=242396/unyielding-netherprism?bonus=1533:12361:12239&ilvl=723&spec=103). Send on cooldown as long as it wont interrupt your main use. Ideally with 5+ targets.
| | [Improvised Seaforium Pacemaker](https://www.wowhead.com/item=232541/improvised-seaforium-pacemaker?bonus=12361:10390:40:1559:10255&class=11&hero=21&ilvl=723&spec=103) |
| | [Sigil of the Cosmic Hunt](https://www.wowhead.com/item=242397/sigil-of-the-cosmic-hunt?class=11&hero=21&ilvl=723&spec=103) | Can arguably be rated higher, as its main benefit is single target.
| | [Ara'kara Sacbrood](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219314/ara-kara-sacbrood?hero=21&ilvl=723&spec=103) |
| | [Void-Touched Fragment](https://www.wowhead.com/item=238386/void-touched-fragment?bonus=1582:12357:12239&class=11&hero=21&ilvl=710&spec=103) | If you find things are dying fast, this moves up the list. (mostly just easier keys). Comes from Delves and is strong for its item level in this content.

> [!WARNING]

### Trinket FAQ

Q: How do I select a secondary other than Mastery for [Soleah's Secret Technique](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=190958/soleahs-secret-technique?bonus=10035:12361:12239&class=11&spec=103)?

A: At the bottom of your sim in simulation options, you can select which stat you want to use. Alternatively, in quick sim you can paste the following into Expert Mode: Post-Combination Actors:
```
profileset."Crit"+=shadowlands.soleahs_secret_technique_type="crit"
profileset."Haste"+=shadowlands.soleahs_secret_technique_type="haste"
profileset."Versatility"+=shadowlands.soleahs_secret_technique_type="versatility"
profileset."Mastery"+=shadowlands.soleahs_secret_technique_type="mastery"

```

Q: Should we be playing double on-use trinkets?

A: No, Feral will typically play just one on-use; though you should always sim just in case. [Cursed Stone Idol](https://www.wowhead.com/item=246344/cursed-stone-idol?bonus=1595:12361:12239&class=11&hero=22&ilvl=723&spec=103) in dungeon sims can be competitive as an example, especially paired with [Unyielding Netherprism](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=242396/unyielding-netherprism?bonus=1533:12361:12239&ilvl=723&spec=103)

Q: How many buffs does [Signet of the Priory](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=219308/signet-of-the-priory?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103) assume?

A: By default, none. You can add the buffs yourself by pasting `thewarwithin.signet_of_the_priory_party_stats=crit/haste/mastery/versatility` into the Custom APL box of your sim. Remove whatever ally stat you dont want to sim. You will find this is incredibly minor.

Q: [Void-Touched Fragment](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=238386/void-touched-fragment?bonus=1582:12357:12239&class=11&ilvl=710&spec=103) is simming better than some of the higher item level stuff on this list for me, should I use it?

A: Absolutely. This trinket is particularly potent for its item level in Mythic+.

Q: Why do damaging items deal more damage as Wildstalker?

A: The Wildstalker Hero Talent !440119|Vigorous Creepers! also buffs the damage of non-druid effects.

Q: [Unyielding Netherprism](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=242396/unyielding-netherprism?bonus=1533:12361:12239&ilvl=723&spec=103) is simming much higher than [Araz's Ritual Forge](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=242402/arazs-ritual-forge?bonus=1533:12361:12239&ilvl=723&spec=103) in dungeonslice, why is it in the same tier?

A: [Unyielding Netherprism](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=242396/unyielding-netherprism?bonus=1533:12361:12239&ilvl=723&spec=103) cheats a bit by not having any on-pull value. Since dungeonslice starts with a single-target boss, this means all of its uses are in AoE. To get a better idea of this trinkets value in comparison to [Araz's Ritual Forge](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=242402/arazs-ritual-forge?bonus=1533:12361:12239&ilvl=723&spec=103), try dungeonroute instead. But also, dying is a fact of life, and that affects this trinket a lot more than the other.

## D.I.S.C Belt

This belt is approximately equivalent to a fully upgraded hero-track belt (710 item level). That being said, belt is a likely craft location, and thus will be replaced by a crafted belt.

Any of the secondary effects can be the best for your character. You can use top-gear's '+' menu to quickly compare all 4 of them. 
The options:

[Static Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1241250/static-charge) (versatility buff)
[Critical Chain](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1241246/critical-chain?ilvl=701) (crit buff)
[Electric Current](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=1236961/electric-current) (mastery buff)
[Spark Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr/spell=1236273/spark-burst) (haste)

Everything else is poorly tuned and should never be used.

## Cyrce's Circlet

Replace this immediately upon logging in. The nerfed version is not competitive with season 2 rings.

# Miscellaneous

## What is snapshotting?

Snapshotting refers to the process of continually ensuring that your strongest bleeds are ticking on your targets. The strength of feral bleed ticks is snapshotted (calculated) at the moment of application and lasts for the duration of the bleed. If certain buffs are active when the bleed is applied, such as !5217|Tiger's Fury!, its snapshot will be stronger.

Tracking the strength of different bleeds manually requires a lot of mental-overhead, so we recommend the use of Weak Aura bleed packages such as those found [here](#useful-weakauras-and-addons). All of our WA packages follow the same general format:
* If the bleed's icon is highlighted in green or its number is higher than 100: applying now results in a stronger bleed than the one you currently have active.
* If the bleed's icon is highlighted in grey or its number is equal to 100: equal value bleed
* If the bleed's icon is highlighted in red or its number is lower than 100: applying now results in a weaker bleed than the one you currently have active.

Note: You will not necessarily upgrade every snapshot. Please review the rotation section.

__Which bleeds snapshot which buffs?__

| DoT | !Tiger's Fury! | !Pouncing Strikes! | !Bloodtalons! | !Moment of Clarity! |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| !Rake! | 	✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| !Thrash! | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| !Rip! | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| !Primal Wrath! | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| !Lunar Inspiration! | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| !Adaptive Swarm! | First Jump Only | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| !Dreadful Wound! | Upgrades and extends | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

> [!TIP]
> !Pouncing Strikes! can be applied via !58984|Shadowmeld!/!Prowl!/!Sudden Ambush!

A dot will ideally be applied only when 30% or less of the prior dot remains. This triggers a mechanic known as “pandemic,” which is common to most damage over time spells.

## What is “pandemic range?”
This term refers to a DoT mechanic in WoW. The baseline duration of a DoT can be extended by up to 30% if a target is already affected by that DoT. Due to the 30% cap on extension, DoTs generally shouldn't be refreshed too early, as potential ticks will be lost. The ideal window of time to refresh a DoT is known as its “pandemic range.”

Let’s use an example. Consider a 10 second DoT:
* Refresh with 1s remaining: the new DoT will be 11s long (10s baseline duration + 1s from prior DoT)
* Refresh with 3s remaining: the new DoT will be 13s long (10s baseline duration + 3s from prior DoT)
* Refresh with 8s remaining: the new DoT will still be 13s long (10s baseline + up to 30% from prior DoT)

It is therefore most efficient to wait until 70% or more of your bleed has ticked to refresh its DoT.

Fun trivia: the name “pandemic” derives from an old warlock passive that was eventually integrated as a baseline feature of damage over time spells.

__What is “clipping?”__

Clipping refers to refreshing a dot prior to its pandemic window. Sometimes you will want to do this with Feral because of snapshotting and/or !Bloodtalons!.

## Macros

Here, we provide a list of helpful macros. These macros are not required, but may be of use to you. Customize them as you see fit.

**Cast Ursol's Vortex at your cursor location (@cursor macro):**

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@cursor] Ursol's Vortex
```

**Use your trinket(s) and/or weapon at the same time as an ability:**

Some trinkets and weapons should be used with a major cooldown. A lot of players will bind these items with Berserk.
* 13 is the top trinket slot
* 14 is the bottom trinket slot
* 16 is your weapon slot

If you would like to use all three items with Berserk, use this macro:

```
#showtooltip
/use 13
/use 14
/use 16
/cast Berserk
```
This macro may be modified. For example, the macro below only uses the 2nd trinket with Berserk:

```
#showtooltip
/use 14
/cast Berserk
```

**Cast Entangling Roots on your mouseover target:**

This macro casts Entangling Roots on your mouseover target. If your mouse is not hovering over a target, the macro instead casts Entangling Roots on your current target.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, harm, nodead] [] Entangling Roots
```

**Dispel/Soothe on the same bind:**

This is the classic help/harm macro, but using mouseovers as well.

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, harm, nodead] Soothe; [@mouseover, help, nodead] Remove Corruption; [harm, nodead] Soothe; Remove Corruption
```

**Skull Bash your Focus target:**

This macro casts Skull Bash on your focus target. If you have not set a focus target, the macro instead casts Skull Bash on your current target.

We recommend creating a keybind that will assign a target as your focus with one click. This option can be found in the game's keybind settings.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@focus, harm, nodead] [] skull bash
```

**Cast Adaptive Swarm on your ally or enemy mouseover target:**

This macro casts Adaptive Swarm on a friendly mouseover target. If your mouse is not hovering over a target, the macro instead casts Adaptive Swarm on your current target.

Many abilities that are cast on allies - Rejuvenation, Regrowth, Innervate, etc - may be macro'd in this fashion. To make those macros, simply replace the term "Adaptive Swarm" with your spell of choice.
If you want mouseover to work for both friendly and enemy targets, replace 'help' with 'exists'. If you want it to only work on enemy targets, replace 'help' with 'harm'.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, help, nodead] [] Adaptive Swarm
```

**Cast Rebirth on an ally:**

This macro casts Rebirth on your current friendly but dead mouseover target. If your ally is alive, the macro instead casts Mark of the Wild.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, help, dead] Rebirth; Mark of the Wild
```

**Why does my mouseover macro not work?**

You probably have it bound to a mouse button, which doesn't allow mouseover macros by default. To fix this, you can use an addon like Clicked, or just map the mouse-button to a different key. Backtick (`)/Tilde (~) can also have this issue. If you don't have it bound to a mouse-button and it still doesn't work, then there is likely an issue with the macro itself. In this case, it's almost always the ommission of help, harm or exists in the brackets containing mouseover.
