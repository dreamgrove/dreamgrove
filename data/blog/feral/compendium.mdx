title: 'Feral Druid Compendium'
patch: '12.0'
draft: false
authors: ["Crazymeow"]
summary: 'Everything you need to know about Feral Druid'
---
# News

Feral Druid, like many other specs, got a ton of changes going into Midnight; mostly with the goal of simplifying the spec into its core components, and removing spells or talents that require information that is impossible to track directly.

This guide is currently updated for Prepatch, but beware that most of these are educated guesses based on prior prepatches and beta testing. 'Proper' theorycrafting won't be complete until somewhere in between Midnight expansion launch and the start of season 1.

Happy Hunting, see you in Midnight.

## Single Target

**What is a priority list?**

When reading the priority lists below, you should not think about these as steps to follow in a specific order. At any given point in combat, you should cast the first thing in the list that you are able to cast.

The way this section is written is very formulaic and has the same structure as the Action Priority List (APL) used in sims.

**Pre-Combat:**

1. !Prowl!
2. !Rake! from stealth.

**Select which talents you have to filter the priority list:**

> [!WARNING]
> This WILL CHANGE. This is a likely-simplified guess that will get you close to the future maximum performance. Sims have not yet been run.

## Raid Talents

This section will get updated before Midnight raids release. Check back later. For some solid guesses on prepatch, see the Generic Raid Build Archetypes.

# Consumables

| Type | Consumable |
|------|---------|
| **DPS Potion** | [Tempered Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=430599/tempered-potion)  |
| **Healing Potion** | [Invigorating Healing Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=244835/invigorating-healing-potion) is the best health potion available. |
| **Food** | [Beledar's Bounty](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222728/beledars-bounty) or any other secondary stat food. |
| **Flask** | [Flask of Alchemical Chaos](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212283/flask-of-alchemical-chaos) |
| **Oil/Stone** | [Algari Mana Oil](https://www.wowhead.com/item=224107/algari-mana-oil) |
| **Augment Rune** | [Crystallized Augment Rune](https://www.wowhead.com/item=224572/crystallized-augment-rune) |

# Gearing

## Stat Priority

> [!WARNING]
> Don't overthink secondary stats too much, main goal of prepatch is just to get your item level as high as you can get it.

## Gems and Enchants

| Slot | Gem/Enchant |
|------|---------|
| **Gems** |  1x [Elusive Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213746/elusive-blasphemite) or [Culminating Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213743/culminating-blasphemite) and a mixture of the other gems based on your sims. It is not worth slotting in a Stamina gem. Personally don't think [Elusive Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213746/elusive-blasphemite) is necessary as a Feral Druid, given that we already have a lot of speed, but it would be a disservice to not mention it. |
| **Weapon** | Any of the secondary-stat weapon enchants; for example: [Stonebound Artistry](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223763/enchant-weapon-stonebound-artistry). |
| **Chest** | [Crystalline Radiance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223692/enchant-chest-crystalline-radiance) |
| **Cloak** | [Chant of Winged Grace](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223731/enchant-cloak-chant-of-winged-grace) |
| **Legs** | [Stormbound Armor Kit](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219911/stormbound-armor-kit) |
| **Wrist** | [Chant of Armored Avoidance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223713/enchant-bracer-chant-of-armored-avoidance) |
| **Boots** | [Defender's March](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223656/enchant-boots-defenders-march) or [Scout's March](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223653/enchant-boots-scouts-march) |
| **Ring** | Any of the Radiant Secondaries, for example: [Radiant Critical Strike](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223662/enchant-ring-radiant-critical-strike) |

> [!TIP]
> Don't forget to add sockets to your rings and necklaces using [Magnificent Jeweler's Setting](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213777/magnificent-jewelers-setting)!

## Crafting


**Crafting Order:**

- [Charged Halberd](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222448/charged-halberd?bonus=8791&class=11&ilvl=636&spec=103) (or any crafted 2h agi weapon) with [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=226022/darkmoon-sigil-ascension). If you already have a myth track weapon, you can skip this.
- Sim the best slot for your gear using [Writhing Armor Banding](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506/writhing-armor-banding) (if you have weapon with [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=226022/darkmoon-sigil-ascension)) or [Dawnthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222868/dawnthread-lining)/[Duskthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222873/duskthread-lining) if you do not.
- Can continue doing the above. Ever since the crest requirement for crafted gear got nerfed this route is equally efficient in that regard.

Ideal is on Wrists and Belt, but you should try to get your item level as high as you can in all slots.

## Trinkets

These trinket lists are in rough estimated order of strength, assuming the highest item level version of the items. Prepatch and scaling is always weird though, so this may be off.

> [!CAUTION]
> Double stat on-use trinkets is generally bad, your second trinket should be a passive.

**On-use trinket ranking**
1. [Araz's Ritual Forge](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=242402/arazs-ritual-forge?bonus=1533:12361:12239&ilvl=723&spec=103)

**For use in Raid:**
| Tier | Trinket | Notes |
| :-: | :- | :- |
| **S Tier** | [Araz's Ritual Forge](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=242402/arazs-ritual-forge?bonus=1533:12361:12239&ilvl=723&spec=103) | 2 min on-use trinket. Macro to berserk, so strong that even a lower item level version of this can be better than your other options.
| **A Tier** | [Astral Antenna](https://www.wowhead.com/item=242395/astral-antenna?class=11&hero=21&ilvl=723&spec=103) | Passive crit proc. Sometimes you can't get full benefit, reducing its value a bit. Can sim with higher miss chance in Raidbots options.
| **B Tier** | [Improvised Seaforium Pacemaker](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=232541/improvised-seaforium-pacemaker?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103) | Cyclical Crit proc.

| | [Empowering Crystal of Anub'ikkaj](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219312/empowering-crystal-of-anubikkaj?class=11&hero=21&ilvl=723&spec=103) | Passive stat proc.
| | [Ara'kara Sacbrood](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219314/ara-kara-sacbrood?hero=21&ilvl=723&spec=103) | A little bit worse for DOTC, but still a solid passive trinket.
| | [So'leah's Secret Technique](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=190958/soleahs-secret-technique?bonus=10035:12361:12239&class=11&spec=103) | True stat stick, sim default is mastery. Higher if you factor in ally buff.

**For use in Mythic+:**
| Tier | Trinket | Notes |
| :-: | :- | :- |
| **S Tier** | [Unyielding Netherpism](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=242396/unyielding-netherprism?bonus=1533:12361:12239&ilvl=723&spec=103) | Macro to Berserk
| **A Tier** | [Astral Antenna](https://www.wowhead.com/item=242395/astral-antenna?class=11&hero=21&ilvl=723&spec=103) |
| **B Tier** | [Empowering Crystal of Anub'ikkaj](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219312/empowering-crystal-of-anubikkaj?class=11&hero=21&ilvl=723&spec=103) |
| | [So'leah's Secret Technique](https://www.wowhead.com/item=185818/soleahs-secret-technique?class=11&hero=21&ilvl=723&spec=103) | Sim which secondary is best, but odds are its mastery. Arguably should be rated higher for consistency + ally benefit.
| | [Cursed Stone Idol](https://www.wowhead.com/item=246344/cursed-stone-idol?bonus=1595:12361:12239&class=11&hero=22&ilvl=723&spec=103) | As a 2nd on-use. Particularly with [Unyielding Netherprism](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=242396/unyielding-netherprism?bonus=1533:12361:12239&ilvl=723&spec=103). Send on cooldown as long as it wont interrupt your main use. Ideally with 5+ targets.
| | [Improvised Seaforium Pacemaker](https://www.wowhead.com/item=232541/improvised-seaforium-pacemaker?bonus=12361:10390:40:1559:10255&class=11&hero=21&ilvl=723&spec=103) |

### Trinket FAQ

Q: Should we be playing double on-use trinkets?

A: No, Feral will typically play just one on-use


Q: How many buffs does [Signet of the Priory](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=219308/signet-of-the-priory?class=11&ilvl=678&spec=103) assume?

A: None. The increase from other people having it is pretty small though.


Q: Why do damaging items deal more damage as Wildstalker?

A: The Wildstalker Hero Talent !440119|Vigorous Creepers! also buffs the damage of non-druid effects.



# Miscellaneous

## What is snapshotting?

Snapshotting is when a damage-over-time (DOT) effect benefits from certain buffs based on how things were when it was applied, rather than dynamically adjusting to the current state. It takes a "snapshot" of those buffs whenever you apply the dot.

Note: You will not necessarily upgrade every snapshot.

__Which bleeds snapshot which buffs?__

| DoT | !Tiger's Fury! | !Pouncing Strikes! |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| !Rake! | 	✅ | ✅ |
| !Rip! | ✅ | ❌ |
| !Primal Wrath! | ✅ | ❌ |
| !Lunar Inspiration! | ✅ | ❌ |
| !Dreadful Wound! | Only Upgrades | ❌ |

> [!TIP]
> !Pouncing Strikes! can be applied via !58984|Shadowmeld! or !Prowl!

A dot will ideally be applied only when 30% or less of the prior dot remains. This triggers a mechanic known as “pandemic,” which is common to most damage over time spells.

## What is “pandemic range?”
This term refers to a DoT mechanic in WoW. The baseline duration of a DoT can be extended by up to 30% if a target is already affected by that DoT. Due to the 30% cap on extension, DoTs generally shouldn't be refreshed too early, as potential ticks will be lost. The ideal window of time to refresh a DoT is known as its “pandemic range.”

Let’s use an example. Consider a 10 second DoT:
* Refresh with 1s remaining: the new DoT will be 11s long (10s baseline duration + 1s from prior DoT)
* Refresh with 3s remaining: the new DoT will be 13s long (10s baseline duration + 3s from prior DoT)
* Refresh with 8s remaining: the new DoT will still be 13s long (10s baseline + up to 30% from prior DoT)

It is therefore most efficient to wait until 70% or more of your bleed has ticked to refresh its DoT.

Fun trivia: the name “pandemic” derives from an old warlock passive that was eventually integrated as a baseline feature of damage over time spells.

__What is “clipping?”__

Clipping refers to refreshing a dot prior to its pandemic window.

## Macros

Here, we provide a list of helpful macros. These macros are not required, but may be of use to you. Customize them as you see fit.

**Cast Ursol's Vortex at your cursor location (@cursor macro):**

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@cursor] Ursol's Vortex
```

**Use your trinket(s) and/or weapon at the same time as an ability:**

Some trinkets and weapons should be used with a major cooldown. A lot of players will bind these items with Berserk.
* 13 is the top trinket slot
* 14 is the bottom trinket slot
* 16 is your weapon slot

If you would like to use all three items with Berserk, use this macro:

```
#showtooltip
/use 13
/use 14
/use 16
/cast Berserk
```
This macro may be modified. For example, the macro below only uses the 2nd trinket with Berserk:

```
#showtooltip
/use 14
/cast Berserk
```

**Cast Entangling Roots on your mouseover target:**

This macro casts Entangling Roots on your mouseover target. If your mouse is not hovering over a target, the macro instead casts Entangling Roots on your current target.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, harm, nodead] [] Entangling Roots
```

**Dispel/Soothe on the same bind:**

This is the classic help/harm macro, but using mouseovers as well.

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, harm, nodead] Soothe; [@mouseover, help, nodead] Remove Corruption; [harm, nodead] Soothe; Remove Corruption
```

**Skull Bash your Focus target:**

This macro casts Skull Bash on your focus target. If you have not set a focus target, the macro instead casts Skull Bash on your current target.

We recommend creating a keybind that will assign a target as your focus with one click. This option can be found in the game's keybind settings.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@focus, harm, nodead] [] skull bash
```

**Rebirth/Motw in one button:**

This macro casts Rebirth on your current friendly but dead mouseover target. If your ally is alive, the macro instead casts Mark of the Wild.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, help, dead] Rebirth; Mark of the Wild
```

**Why does my mouseover macro not work?**

You probably have it bound to a mouse button, which doesn't allow mouseover macros by default. To fix this, you can use an addon like Clicked, or just map the mouse-button to a different key. Backtick (`)/Tilde (~) can also have this issue. If you don't have it bound to a mouse-button and it still doesn't work, then there is likely an issue with the macro itself. In this case, it's almost always the ommission of help, harm or exists in the brackets containing mouseover.
