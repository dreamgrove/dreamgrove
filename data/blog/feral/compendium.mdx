# News

## Bug in sim fixed as of January 11th

There was a bug in sims where Killing Strikes wasn't properly applying the agility to your character. This has now been fixed and Killing Strikes is just always better than Ruthless Aggression now. This also means that the new Druid of the Claw pure-single target build is now roughly equal to Wildstalker's pure-single target build. The talent builds below have been updated to reflect this.


## Cyrce's Circlet

First of all, this ring is worth equipping and ends up being a substantial dps gain, the value of which depending on what you currently have and what item level you can upgrade it to by time you are reading this. Much like the Onyx Annulet from Dragonflight, there are 3 special gem slots of different typing; Thunder Citrine, Sea Citrine and Wind Citrine. 

### Available Citrines

Thunder Citrine Options: [Storm Sewer's Citrine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228642/storm-sewers-citrine) [Roaring War-Queen Citrine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228648/roaring-war-queens-citrine) [Stormbringer's Runed Citrine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228638/stormbringers-runed-citrine) and [Thunderlord's Crackling Citrine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228634/thunderlords-crackling-citrine)

Sea Citrine Options: [Mariner's Hallowed Citrine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228644/mariners-hallowed-citrine) [Seabed Leviathan's Citrine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228647/seabed-leviathans-citrine)[Fathomdweller's Runed Citrine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228639/fathomdwellers-runed-citrine) and [Undersea Overseer's Citrine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228636/undersea-overseers-citrine)

Wind Citrine Options: [Old Salt's Bardic Citrine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228643/old-salts-bardic-citrine) [Legendary Skipper's Citrine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228646/legendary-skippers-citrine) [Windsinger's Runed Citrine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228640/windsingers-runed-citrine) and [Squall Sailor's Citrine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228635/squall-sailors-citrine)

### Recommended Citrines

Thunder Citrine: Always play [Stormbringer's Runed Citrine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228638/stormbringers-runed-citrine). You can optionally play [Roaring War-Queen Citrine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228648/roaring-war-queens-citrine) in raid for similar-to-potentially-slightly-better results.

Sea Citrine: Always play [Fathomdweller's Runed Citrine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228639/fathomdwellers-runed-citrine). The other options are not very good.

Wind Citrine: For maximum group dps, you should always play [Legendary Skipper's Citrine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228646/legendary-skippers-citrine). That being said, [Windsinger's Runed Citrine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=228640/windsingers-runed-citrine) is generally more personal dps.



## Blackrock Depths raid

There is nothing of note in this raid for Feral Druids power-wise. The available trinkets are subpar, and [Flame Wrath](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=231413/flame-wrath) is too low item level to be worth over crafted/myth track weapons. That being said, the raid is another source of hero-track gear if you are lacking in that department.

Non-power wise, you can get updated transmogs of the T2 set bonuses and other cosmetics in this patch. See this [Wowhead guide](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/world-events/20th-anniversary-celebration-rewards) for more information.

**What is a priority list?**

When reading the priority lists below, you should not think about these as steps to follow in a specific order. At any given point in combat, you should cast the first thing in the list that you are able to cast.

The way this section is written is very formulaic and has the same structure as the Action Priority List (APL) used in sims.

**Pre-Combat:**
1. !Heart of the Wild!
2. !Prowl!
3. !Rake! from stealth.

# Talents:

## Raid Talents:

Feral has a lot of build options for raid, and perhaps the most significant choices of those being which Hero tree you play. Here, we’ll try to outline situations you might play one or the other, but keep in mind both are competitive and nothing should be set in stone. It’s recommended you play around and see what works for you, and to also check out what others are running on logs.

Note: until you get your 4-set, you should play Wildstalker.

Single Target: With 4-set, Wildstalker is a bit better in pure single-target, especially with Druid of the Claw being punished slightly more by downtime compared to Wildstalker.

Fights with Adds: Druid of the Claw will often be the better option, particularly as adds in raid are typically short-lived. !441583|Ravage! plays into this much better than !439531|Bloodseeker Vines!. That and Druid of the Claw has !441841|Bestial Strength! offering better AOE with just a single talent point invested into !285381|Primal Wrath!. Conversely, Wildstalkers focus on damage over time effects naturally loses value when mobs die too quickly.

Cleave or Council fights: With extended multi-target (2-4), Wildstalker likely wins out slightly, as its multi-target value is partly dependent on Rake and targets living long enough. That being said, the two are fairly close in this scenario, and the choice likely depends on other factors on these sorts of fights.

## Dungeon Talents:

![DOTC](/static/images/dotcm%2B.jpg) 

Feral goes into TWW with even more options when it comes to M+, with both Hero trees creating two distinct options on their own, and within each the widest variety of spec-tree talent options yet. Embrace these options and find what works for you, there is simply no ‘best’ build, especially because different talents will suit different dungeons and groups. However listed below are some reference builds you can play around with, and the images above can help guide you to customise these builds to your liking.

### Talent Explanations:

<details>
<summary>Section 1 Options Explained</summary> 

!383352|Tireless Energy!: generally it’s recommended you take 1 point in this, unless running Thrashing Claws as Wildstalker. Two points as Druid of the Claw can be decent too.

!391700|Double-Clawed Rake!: always run this as Wildstalker. Optionally strong for cleave and medium (pug-size) pulls as Druid of the Claw. 

!231063|Merciless Claws!: particularly good as Druid of the Claw, providing good single-target, decent AOE, and great burst, particularly due to its synergy with !384668|Berserk: Frenzy!.

!405300|Thrashing Claws!: great option if running Lunar Inspiration, frees up more globals to Moonfire more. Video guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IwnGdWeD-k). 

</details>

<details>
<summary>Section 2 Options Explained</summary> 

!384665|Taste for Blood!: strong single-target and funnel (if a particular dungeon has priority mobs you want to funnel Apex procs into). Strong synergy with !391528|Convoke!, and particularly Druid of the Claw in general.

!48484|Infected Wounds!: decent single-target and cleave, particularly good if playing !391700|Double-Clawed Rake! and Wildstalker in general. As Druid of the Claw this is generally only taken if playing !384665|Taste for Blood!.

!384667|Sudden Ambush!: good single-target, and similar to above can be great for cleave due to the synergy it has with !391700|Double-Clawed Rake!. Generally recommended as Wildstalker, but this expansion can be easily skipped as Druid of the Claw for dungeons with large pull sizes or when playing !231063|Merciless Claws! ‘swipe builds’.

!449645|Savage Fury!: great burst and great for larger pull sizes, however a little bit less effective on single-target. Longer travel time between packs in some dungeons can give time for TF to reset, thereby giving talents like this higher overall uptime as well. Also of note, one of the m+ affixes this season gives cooldown reduction, which this talent greatly benefits from.

!155580|Lunar Inspiration!: strong single-target and cleave as Wildstalker, and can help proc Bloodtalons more often.

!236068|Moment of Clarity!: good single-target and decent all-rounder, can help if you are struggling with energy too.

!391078|Raging Fury! vs !391872|Tiger’s Tenacity!: both are good for both Hero trees, Tiger’s Tenacity is generally a bit better overall, particularly with DOT-focused builds, but Raging Fury is competitive and the added uptime can be useful depending on how long packs are living, or if you simply prefer playing with a higher uptime on !5217|Tiger’s Fury!.

!Brutal Slash! vs !390864|Wild Slashes!: !Brutal Slash! is always better, largely due to it being a relevant dps gain in Single Target, unlike !390864|Wild Slashes!. That being said, !390864|Wild Slashes! has a straightforward way of playing, and is decent enough to comment on. Do NOT pair !390864|Wild Slashes! with !391700|Double-Clawed Rake!. Talent !231063|Merciless Claws! instead.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Section 3 Options Explained</summary> 

!391528|Convoke! vs !102543|Incarn!: Druid of the Claw in general favours !391528|Convoke!, however both are competitive as Wildstalker, with an edge towards !391528|Convoke!. Similar to last expansion, !391528|Convoke! is a bit more single-target oriented than !102543|Incarn!, however it still offers great AOE burst as well. If you drop !384665|Taste for Blood! with Wildstalker, Incarn should be very competitive, and I recommend playing around with it in different dungeons, especially if there’s any boss mechanics you can dodge with the free Prowl cast.

!319439|Bloodtalons! vs !391972|Lion’s Strength!: similar to last expansion, feel free to play the latter for an easier option if you are learning the spec or simply prefer it. The difference is probably even smaller than sims suggest as you’ll be making less mistakes and can focus that tiny bit more on mechanics or crowd control. 

!391888|Adaptive Swarm!: good for both Hero trees, with 1 point in bees is one of the single best options you can take for pure single-target, and I would recommend running it almost all the time as Wildstalker. 2 points into !391951|Unbridled! ‘beekeeping’ is where it gets really interesting if you want more cleave and AOE value, particularly on medium size pulls. However its value drops off on really large AOE.

!390902|Carnivorous Instinct!: good all-rounder, with particular strength in large AOE, and for burst, due to not only amplifying !5217|Tiger’s Fury!, but also synergies with !343223|Berserk! and !391528|Convoke!. Related to burst, it’s one of the only talents in the bottom section that buffs Brutal Slash for example, which again is stronger inside of !343223|Berserk!. Gains even more value if playing !391078|Raging Fury!.

!274837|Feral Frenzy!: a good single-target/prio option for both Hero trees, and decent in AOE as well, as it can help you weave !Ferocious Bite! with the free combo points. 

!391347|Rip & Tear! vs !391978|Veinripper!: this node is more competitive than ever, and somewhat comes down to R&T offering more AOE, with Veinripper offering more priority damage - as the added !Rip! duration in AOE can help you weave !Ferocious Bite!. However the added !Rake! duration is also great for Wildstalker, with more !Rake! uptime resulting in higher !439531|Bloodseeker Vines! uptime.

!421432|Saber Jaws!: a pure single-target option for Druid of the Claw, its value will vary significantly based on dungeon.

# Consumables:

## Potions

[Tempered Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=430599/tempered-potion) is your dps potion for every situation.

[Algari Healing Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/item=211880/algari-healing-potion) is the only health potion available. That being said, if you find yourself equipped with an engineering crafted piece, [Heartseeking Health Injector](https://www.wowhead.com/item=221910/tinker-heartseeking-health-injector) can situationally be a superior option.

## Food

[Feast of the Midnight Masquerade](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222733/feast-of-the-midnight-masquerade), [Feast of the Divine Day](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=445112/feast-of-the-divine-day) and [Beledar's Bounty](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222728/beledars-bounty) are all essentially equal, with [Beledar's Bounty](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222728/beledars-bounty) being by far the cheapest option.

## Phials

[Flask of Alchemical Chaos](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212283/flask-of-alchemical-chaos) for every situation

## Weapon Oils/Stones

[Ironclaw Whetstone](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222503/ironclaw-whetstone)/[Ironclaw Weightstone](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222510/ironclaw-weightstone) or [Algari Mana Oil](https://www.wowhead.com/item=224107/algari-mana-oil). These have very similar value, though [Algari Mana Oil](https://www.wowhead.com/item=224107/algari-mana-oil) is much cheaper.

## Augment Rune

[Crystallized Augment Rune](https://www.wowhead.com/item=224572/crystallized-augment-rune)

# Gearing:
 
## Stat Priority:

Sim yourself using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). Do not follow any stat priorities.

## Gems and Enchants

Gems:  1x [Elusive Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213746/elusive-blasphemite) or [Culminating Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213743/culminating-blasphemite) and a mixture of the other gems based on your sims. It is not worth slotting in a Stamina gem. Personally don't think [Elusive Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213746/elusive-blasphemite) is necessary as a Feral Druid, given that we already have a lot of speed, but it would be a disservice to not mention it.

Weapon:  [Authority of Radiant Power](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223781/enchant-weapon-authority-of-radiant-power) Thereotically, [Stonebound Artistry](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223765/enchant-weapon-stonebound-artistry) is the best for pure AoE, but that is fairly rare.

Chest:  [Crystalline Radiance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223692/enchant-chest-crystalline-radiance)

Cloak:  [Chant of Winged Grace](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223731/enchant-cloak-chant-of-winged-grace)

Legs:  [Stormbound Armor Kit](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219911/stormbound-armor-kit)

Wrist:  [Chant of Armored Avoidance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223713/enchant-bracer-chant-of-armored-avoidance)

Boots:  [Defender's March](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223656/enchant-boots-defenders-march) or [Scout's March](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223653/enchant-boots-scouts-march)

Ring:  You should always sim your own character to determine what enchant to use in this slot. They tend to be very close. If you don't want to sim, [Radiant Mastery](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223677/enchant-ring-radiant-mastery) is usually a safe choice.

## Crafting

- [Charged Halberd](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222448/charged-halberd?bonus=8791&class=11&ilvl=636&spec=103) (or any crafted 2h agi weapon) with [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=226022/darkmoon-sigil-ascension). If you already have a myth track weapon, you can skip this.
- Sim the best slot for your gear using [Writhing Armor Banding](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506/writhing-armor-banding) (if you have weapon with [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=226022/darkmoon-sigil-ascension)) or [Elemental Focusing Lens](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213770/elemental-focusing-lens) for Raid. For mythic+ you should instead use [Dawnthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222868/dawnthread-lining). 
- Can continue doing the above. Ever since the crest requirement for crafted gear got nerfed this route is equally efficient in that regard.

Special Note: You can craft 610 PvE item level PvP gear with [Forged Gladiator's Heraldry](https://www.wowhead.com/item=210233/forged-gladiators-heraldry) and slot your 2nd embellishment slot on that at the start. This requires farming 525-700 conquest depending on item slot. This item can additionally be socketed by farming Honor to purchase [Vicious Jeweler's Setting](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213778/vicious-jewelers-setting).

## Trinkets

These trinket lists are in rough order of strength, assuming the highest item level version of the items. You should always sim your own character to determine which trinkets you should equip. 

**For use in Raid:**
- [Skardyn's Grace](https://www.wowhead.com/item=56115/skardyns-grace?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103)
- [Treacherous Transmitter](https://www.wowhead.com/item=221023/treacherous-transmitter?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103) Play as 2 minute CD
- [Mad Queen's Mandate](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212454/mad-queens-mandate?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103) This is our strongest trinket to pair with [Skardyn's Grace](https://www.wowhead.com/item=56115/skardyns-grace?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103) for Wildstalker despite being a 2nd on-use.
- [Ovi'nax's Mercurial Egg](https://www.wowhead.com/item=220305/ovinaxs-mercurial-egg) Play this instead of [Mad Queen's Mandate](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212454/mad-queens-mandate?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103) as long as Mastery is your highest secondary if you're playing Druid of the Claw. Try to hover around 20 stacks of agi/standing still.
- [Void Reaper's Contract](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212456/void-reapers-contract?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103)
- [Ara'kara Sacbrood](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219314/ara-kara-sacbrood?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103)
- [Dead-eye Spyglass](https://www.wowhead.com/item=159623/dead-eye-spyglass?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103)
- [Empowering Crystal of Anub'ikkaj](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219312/empowering-crystal-of-anubikkaj?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103)

**For use in Mythic+:**
- [Skardyn's Grace](https://www.wowhead.com/item=56115/skardyns-grace?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103) In keys, this is a must-have trinket. It's farmable and also clearly the best choice.
- [Treacherous Transmitter](https://www.wowhead.com/item=221023/treacherous-transmitter?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103). Generally weaker than [Skardyn's Grace](https://www.wowhead.com/item=56115/skardyns-grace?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103), unless you have the cooldown reduction mythic plus affix that week, where it really shines due to its cooldown being shorter than 2 minutes.
- [Ovi'nax's Mercurial Egg](https://www.wowhead.com/item=220305/ovinaxs-mercurial-egg) This is generally going to be your next-best option for keys.
- [Empowering Crystal of Anub'ikkaj](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219312/empowering-crystal-of-anubikkaj?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103)
- [Dead-eye Spyglass](https://www.wowhead.com/item=159623/dead-eye-spyglass?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103)
- [Ara'kara Sacbrood](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219314/ara-kara-sacbrood?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103)
- [Shadow-Binding Ritual Knife](https://www.wowhead.com/item=215178/shadow-binding-ritual-knife) Really good for its item level, not having a myth track version bumps it down the list though.
- [Mad Queen's Mandate](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212454/mad-queens-mandate?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103) Niche good if needed for prio damage/critical adds

### Trinket FAQ

Q: How does [Ovi'nax's Mercurial Egg](https://www.wowhead.com/item=220305/ovinaxs-mercurial-egg) work in sims and can I change the stacks?

A: To sim [Ovi'nax's Mercurial Egg](https://www.wowhead.com/item=220305/ovinaxs-mercurial-egg) at different stack counts, copy the following into the Custom APL box in Raidbots:

```
thewarwithin.ovinaxs_mercurial_egg_initial_primary_stacks=20
thewarwithin.ovinaxs_mercurial_egg_desired_primary_stacks=20
```

From here, you can tweak the **desired_primary_stacks** value to see how the trinket performs at different stack counts. The sim will hover around the desired stack count of the 'standing still' buff. The given is the default setting.

Q: [Shadow-Binding Ritual Knife](https://www.wowhead.com/item=215178/shadow-binding-ritual-knife) is simming better than some of the other stuff on this list for me, should I use it?

A: Absolutely. This trinket is particularly potent for its item level, the only reason it isn't on the list is because it can't be acquired at myth track item level.

Q: How do I use [Treacherous Transmitter](https://www.wowhead.com/item=221023/treacherous-transmitter?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103)?

A: Treat it like a 2 minute on-use, but make sure you send it a few seconds before cooldowns. This gives you time to complete the task for when you want the buff.

There are 3 possible tasks.
1. Jump three times
2. Stand on a purple disc
3. Collect a moving orb

You can use [this weakaura](https://wago.io/rZdjR8Vm7) to track the task you need to complete.

Q: Why does [Mad Queen's Mandate](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212454/mad-queens-mandate?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103) do more damage as Wildstalker?

A: The Wildstalker Hero Talent !440119|Vigorous Creepers! buffs non-feral damage as well, including the damage from the trinket.

# Miscellaneous:

## What is snapshotting?

Snapshotting refers to the process of continually ensuring that your strongest bleeds are ticking on your targets. The strength of feral bleed ticks is snapshotted (calculated) at the moment of application and lasts for the duration of the bleed. If certain buffs are active when the bleed is applied, such as !5217|Tiger's Fury!, the damage of its snapshot will be stronger. A good feral player is aware of this and will weave between applying stronger bleeds and leaving currently ticking bleeds alone. 

Tracking the strength of different bleeds across multiple/changing mobs is notoriously difficult, so we recommend the use of Weak Aura bleed packages such as those found in dreamgrove.gg. All our WA packages follow the same general format:
* If the bleed’s icon is highlighted in green or its number is higher than 100: this is a stronger bleed than the one you currently have active.
* If the bleed’s icon is highlighted in grey or its number is equal to 100: equal value bleed
* If the bleed’s icon is highlighted in red or its number is lower than 100: this is a weaker bleed than the one you currently have active.

Note: You will not necessarily upgrade every snapshot. Please review the rotation section.

__Which bleeds are snapshotted?__

1. All Feral dots and bleeds will snapshot at higher values when paired with !5217|Tiger's Fury!
2. !Rake! will also snapshot 
    - !Prowl!
    - !58984|Shadowmeld!
    - !Sudden Ambush! procs due to !390772|Pouncing Strikes!
3. !Rip! will also snapshot !Bloodtalons!
4. !Thrash! will also snapshot !236068|Moment of Clarity!

A dot will ideally be applied only when 30% or less of the prior dot remains. This triggers a mechanic known as “pandemic,” which is common to most damage over time spells.  

## What is “pandemic range?”
This term refers to a DoT mechanic in WoW. The baseline duration of a DoT can be extended by up to 30% if a target is already affected by that DoT. Due to the 30% cap on extension, DoTs generally shouldn't be refreshed too early, as potential ticks will be lost. The ideal window of time to refresh a DoT is known as its “pandemic range.” 

Let’s use an example. Consider a 10 second DoT:
* Refresh with 1s remaining: the new DoT will be 11s long (10s baseline duration + 1s from prior DoT)
* Refresh with 3s remaining: the new DoT will be 13s long (10s baseline duration + 3s from prior DoT)
* Refresh with 8s remaining: the new DoT will still be 13s long (10s baseline + up to 30% from prior DoT)

It is therefore most efficient to wait until 70% or more of your bleed has ticked to refresh its DoT. 

Fun trivia: the name “pandemic” derives from an old warlock passive that was eventually integrated as a baseline feature of damage over time spells. 

__What is “clipping?”__

Clipping refers to refreshing a dot prior to its pandemic window. Sometimes you will want to do this with Feral because of snapshotting and/or !Bloodtalons!.

## Macros

Here, we provide a list of helpful macros. These macros are not _required_, but using them may elevate your gameplay. (_Note:_ These macros are not set in stone. Customize them as you see fit!)

**Cast Ursol's Vortex at your cursor location (@cursor macro):**

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@cursor] Ursol's Vortex
```

**Use your trinket(s) and/or weapon at the same time as an ability:**

Some trinkets and weapons should be used with a major cooldown. A lot of players will bind these items with Berserk. 
* 13 is the top trinket slot
* 14 is the bottom trinket slot
* 16 is your weapon slot

If you would like to use all three items with Berserk, use this macro:

```
#showtooltip
/use 13
/use 14
/use 16
/cast Berserk
```
This macro may be modified. For example, the macro below only uses the 2nd trinket with Berserk:

```
#showtooltip
/use 14
/cast Berserk
```

**Cast Entangling Roots on your mouseover target:**

This macro casts Entangling Roots on your mouseover target. If your mouse is not hovering over a target, the macro instead casts Entangling Roots on your current target.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, harm, nodead] [] Entangling Roots
```

**Dispel/Soothe on the same bind:**

This is the classic help/harm macro, but using mouseovers as well.

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, harm, nodead] Soothe; [@mouseover, help, nodead] Remove Corruption; [harm, nodead] Soothe; Remove Corruption
```

**Skull Bash your Focus target:**

This macro casts Skull Bash on your focus target. If you have not set a focus target, the macro instead casts Skull Bash on your current target.

We recommend creating a keybind that will assign a target as your focus with one click. This option can be found in the game's keybind settings. 
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@focus, harm, nodead] [] skull bash
```

**Cast Adaptive Swarm on your ally or enemy mouseover target:**

This macro casts Adaptive Swarm on a friendly mouseover target. If your mouse is not hovering over a target, the macro instead casts Adaptive Swarm on your current target.

Many abilities that are cast on allies - Rejuvenation, Regrowth, Innervate, etc - may be macro'd in this fashion. To make those macros, simply replace the term "Adaptive Swarm" with your spell of choice.
If you want mouseover to work for both friendly and enemy targets, replace 'help' with 'exists'. If you want it to only work on enemy targets, replace 'help' with 'harm'.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, help, nodead] [] Adaptive Swarm 
```

**Cast Rebirth on an ally:**

This macro casts Rebirth on your current friendly but dead mouseover target. If your ally is alive, the macro instead casts Mark of the Wild.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, help, dead] Rebirth; Mark of the Wild
```

**Why does my mouseover macro not work?**

You probably have it bound to a mouse button, which doesn't allow mouseover macros by default. To fix this, you can use an addon like Clicked, or just map the mouse-button to a different key. Backtick (`)/Tilde (~) can also have this issue. If you don't have it bound to a mouse-button and it still doesn't work, then there is likely an issue with the macro itself. In this case, it's almost always the ommission of help, harm or exists in the brackets containing mouseover.
 
## Useful WeakAura(s) and Addons

### **Full WeakAura Packages for Feral**
To play feral competently, many variables must be tracked. A single WeakAura is not up to this task, so our contributors have spent many hours assembling full WA packages from individual WeakAuras. 

Each package contains multiple WeakAuras that work with each other to help you understand what's happening in combat. No package is superior to the others in the list. We recommend you try out several, and settle on your favorite.
