<summary>Advanced Single Target Priority</summary>

**What is a priority list?**

When reading the priority lists below, you should not think about these as steps to follow in a specific order. At any given point in combat, you should cast the first thing in the list that you are able to cast.

The way this section is written is very formulaic and has the same structure as the Action Priority List (APL) used in sims.

**Pre-Combat:**
1. !Heart of the Wild!
2. !Prowl!
3. !Rake! from stealth.

**Select which talents you have talented to filter the priority list:**

<CheckboxProvider>

**Single Target priority list:**

1. !Tiger's Fury! with 5 combo points or if you're missing more than 35 energy.
2. [*Apex Predator's Craving&&Bloodtalons] !Ferocious Bite! with !Apex Predator's Craving! procs if it won't disrupt procing !Bloodtalons!.

    - There isn't an !Adaptive Swarm! heading to an enemy target, AND
    - !Adaptive Swarm! is either not applied, or is close to expiration with 1 or 2 stacks.

    - If you have 3 !391888|Adaptive Swarms! with at least 2 stacks out then you will target allies with priority 1 stack > 0 stack > 2 stacks.
    - If you have 2 or fewer !391888|Adaptive Swarms! of at least 2 stacks, cast on your enemy target when swarm is not on them, and is not traveling towards them.
6. [*Incarnation] !102543|Incarnation! if it's ready.
7. [*~Incarnation] !Berserk! if it's ready.
8. [*Feral Frenzy] !Feral Frenzy! with 1 or no combo points. 2 is also acceptable during !102543|Incarn!/!Berserk!. 
9. [*Convoke the Spirits] !391528|Convoke! when:
    - !Rip! is up. AND
    - !Tiger's Fury! is up. AND
    - You have 2 or fewer combo points outside !102543|Incarn!/!Berserk! or 3 or fewer inside !102543|Incarn!/!Berserk!.

# Talents:

This section is still a work in progress and will be updated before raid/m+ release, so check back before then.

# Consumables:

## Potions

[Tempered Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=430599/tempered-potion) for every situation

## Food

[Feast of the Midnight Masquerade](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222733/feast-of-the-midnight-masquerade) or [Feast of the Divine Day](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=445112/feast-of-the-divine-day)

## Phials

[Flask of Alchemical Chaos](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212283/flask-of-alchemical-chaos) for every situation

## Weapon Rune

[Ironclaw Whetstone](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222503/ironclaw-whetstone) or [Algari Mana Oil](https://www.wowhead.com/item=224107/algari-mana-oil). These have extremely similar value, though you should default to [Ironclaw Whetstone](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222503/ironclaw-whetstone).

# Gearing:
 
## Stat Priority:

Sim yourself using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). Do not follow any stat priorities.

## Gems and Enchants

Gems - 1x [Elusive Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213746/elusive-blasphemite) or [Culminating Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213743/culminating-blasphemite) and a mixture of the other gems based on your sims. I would generally recommend [Elusive Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213746/elusive-blasphemite), as the crit effect portion of [Culminating Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213743/culminating-blasphemite) is incredibly weak.

Weapon - [Authority of the Depths](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223784/enchant-weapon-authority-of-the-depths) for raid, [Stonebound Artistry](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223765/enchant-weapon-stonebound-artistry) or [Stormrider's Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223762/enchant-weapon-stormriders-fury) for M+

Chest - [Crystalline Radiance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223692/enchant-chest-crystalline-radiance)

Cloak - [Chant of Winged Grace](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223731/enchant-cloak-chant-of-winged-grace)

Legs - [Stormbound Armor Kit](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219911/stormbound-armor-kit)

Boots - [Defender's March](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223656/enchant-boots-defenders-march) or [Scout's March](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223653/enchant-boots-scouts-march)

Ring -  You should always sim your own character to determine what enchant to use in this slot. They tend to be very close.

## Embellishments

Currently still awaiting tuning and for some embellishments to be fixed in game. This section will be updated closer to Raid release.

## Trinkets

Much like embellishments, this section will be updated closer to Raid/m+ release. In the meantime do Delves just in case blizzard makes on busted by accident.

# Miscellaneous:

## What is snapshotting?

Snapshotting refers to the process of continually ensuring that your strongest bleeds are ticking on your targets. The strength of feral bleed ticks is snapshotted (calculated) at the moment of application and lasts for the duration of the bleed. If certain buffs are active when the bleed is applied, such as !Tiger’s Fury!, the damage of its snapshot will be stronger. A good feral player is aware of this and will weave between applying stronger bleeds and leaving currently ticking bleeds alone. 

Tracking the strength of different bleeds across multiple/changing mobs is notoriously difficult, so we recommend the use of Weak Aura bleed packages such as those found in dreamgrove.gg. All our WA packages follow the same general format:
* If the bleed’s icon is highlighted in green or its number is higher than 100: this is a stronger bleed than the one you currently have active
* If the bleed’s icon is highlighted in grey or its number is equal to 100: equal value bleed
* If the bleed’s icon is highlighted in red or its number is lower than 100: this is a weaker bleed than the one you currently have active

Note: You will not necessarily upgrade every snapshot. Please review the rotation section.

__Which bleeds are snapshotted?__

* _All_ feral bleeds will snapshot at higher values when paired with:
    * !Tiger’s Fury!
* !Rake!’s snapshot can also be buffed by: 
    * !Prowl!
    * !Shadowmeld!
    * !390772|Pouncing Strikes! procs
* Rip’s snapshot can also be buffed by:
    * !Bloodtalons!
* Thrash’s snapshot can also be buffed by:
    * !236068|Moment of Clarity!

A bleed will ideally be applied only when 30% or less of the prior bleed remains. This triggers a mechanic known as “pandemic,” which is common to most damage over time spells.  

## What is “pandemic range?”
This term refers to a DoT mechanic in WoW. The baseline duration of a DoT can be extended by up to 30% if a target is already affected by that DoT. Due to the 30% cap on extension, the DoT ought not to be refreshed early, or potential ticks will be lost. The ideal window of time to refresh a DoT is known as its “pandemic range.” 

Let’s use an example. Consider a 10 second DoT:
* Refresh with 1s remaining: the new DoT will be 11s long (10s baseline duration + 1s from prior DoT)
* Refresh with 3s remaining: the new DoT will be 13s long (10s baseline duration + 3s from prior DoT)
* Refresh with 8s remaining: the new DoT will still be 13s long (10s baseline + up to 30% from prior DoT)

It is therefore best to wait until 70% or more of your bleed has ticked to refresh its DoT. 

Fun trivia: the name “pandemic” derives from an old warlock passive that was eventually integrated as a baseline feature of damage over time spells. 

__What is “clipping?”__

Clipping refers to refreshing a dot prior to its pandemic window.
_Important note:_ Rake is the only bleed that ought to be clipped early to maintain stronger snapshots.

## Macros

Here, we provide a list of helpful macros. These macros are not _required_, but using them may elevate your gameplay. (_Note:_ These macros are not set in stone. Customize them as you see fit!)

**Cast Ursol's Vortex at your cursor location (@cursor macro):**

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@cursor] Ursol's Vortex
```

**Use your trinket(s) and/or weapon at the same time as an ability:**

Some trinkets and weapons ought to be procced at the same time as a major cooldown. It is best to macro these items with Berserk. 
* 13 is the top trinket slot
* 14 is the bottom trinket slot
* 16 is your weapon slot

If you would like to use all three items with Berserk, use this macro:

```
#showtooltip
/use 13
/use 14
/use 16
/cast Berserk
```
This macro may be modified. For example, the macro below only uses the 2nd trinket with Berserk:

```
#showtooltip
/use 14
/cast Berserk
```

**Cast Entangling Roots on your mouseover target:**

This macro casts Entangling Roots on your mouseover target. If your mouse is not hovering over a target, the macro instead casts Entangling Roots on your current target.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, harm, nodead] [] Entangling Roots
```

**Skull Bash your Focus target:**

This macro casts Skull Bash on your focus target. If you have not set a focus target, the macro instead casts Skull Bash on your current target.

We recommend creating a keybind that will assign a target as your focus with one click. This option can be found in the game's keybind settings. 
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@focus, harm, nodead] [] skull bash
```

**Cast Adaptive Swarm on your ally or enemy mouseover target:**

This macro casts Adaptive Swarm on your mouseover target. If your mouse is not hovering over a target, the macro instead casts Adaptive Swarm on your current target. (Your mouseover target may be an ally.)

Many abilities that are cast on allies - Rejuvenation, Regrowth, Innervate, etc - may be macro'd in this fashion. To make those macros, simply replace the term "Adaptive Swarm" with your spell of choice.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, help, nodead] [] Adaptive Swarm 
```

**Cast Rebirth on an ally:**

This macro casts Rebirth on your current friendly mouseover target. If your ally is alive, the macro instead casts Mark of the Wild.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, help, dead] Rebirth; Mark of the Wild
```
 
## Useful WeakAura(s) and Addons

### **Full WeakAura Packages for Feral**
To play feral competently, many variables must be tracked. A single WeakAura is not up to this task, so our contributors have spent many hours assembling full WA packages from individual WeakAuras. 

Each package contains multiple WeakAuras that work with each other to help you understand what's happening in combat. No package is superior to the others in the list. We recommend you try out several, and settle on your favorite.
