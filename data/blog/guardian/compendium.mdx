## Mythic+ Talents

[Non Toi](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/druid/guardian/druid-of-the-claw/DAQBAUFAiFQFERRalQFBQOVFERIhUVhRRQRUCAAEFVVUBQ)

Very classic we don't shift because shifting in keys is next to worthless, if you want to shift on bosses shift the point from Improved barkskin/Verdant heart into rake/rip

[ToI](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/druid/guardian/druid-of-the-claw/DAQBAUFAiFQFERRalQFBQOVFEVKAVRVRRQRUBAEFVVUBQ)

Same idea except we lean heavily into ToI and only press maul/raze while TnC is up

[No IF](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/druid/guardian/druid-of-the-claw/DAQBAUBAmEQVEURalQFBQOVFERIhUVhVIEQFBAEFVVUBE)

Kinda a meme kinda not try it out to express your rage at no changes

[LB cdr/Arcane Thrash/BF:](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/druid/guardian/elunes-chosen/DAQBAUFAiFQFERRalQFBQOVFERIhUVhVRERBBAEFVVUCEQ)

Rotation as normal to compare and contrast with [LB cdr/Arcane Thrash/Incarn](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/druid/guardian/elunes-chosen/DAQBAUFAiFQFERRalQFBQOVFERIhUVhVQURBCAAEFVVUCEQ) to see how the rage generation works out 

[ToI/LB cdr/Arcane Thrash/BF](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/druid/guardian/elunes-chosen/DAQBAUFAiFQFERRalQFBQOVFERKAVRlVRERBBAEFVVUCEQ)

Rotation would be !Mangle!/!Thrash!/!Moonfire!/!Moonfire! That should net you effectively permanent Lunar Beam, All rage goes into Iron Fur, any TnC proc into Raze/Maul (after testing this is likely bad but still worth looking into to make sure) 

## Raid Talents

[ToI](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/druid/guardian/elunes-chosen/DAQBAUFAiFQFERRalQFBQOVFERKAVRlVAUQVBAEFVVUCAQ)

Same idea as above. spam IF/!Mangle!/!Thrash!/!Moonfire! as much as possible 

[Non ToI](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/druid/guardian/elunes-chosen/DAQBAUFAiFQFERRalQFBQOVFERIhUVhVAUQVCAAEFVVUCAQ)

Rotation as normal

[Non ToI but with Catweaving](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/druid/guardian/elunes-chosen/DAQRAEUAiFQVERRKkRFBQOVFERIhUVhVAUQVCAQEFVVUCAQ)

Thanks to Fluid Form we can shift very easily (only shift if: rage is lower than 40). Shifting rotation would be !Rake!>!Rip!>Convoke>!Rip!>!Mangle!

[Non Toi Boomweaving](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/druid/guardian/elunes-chosen/DAQBQVFEiFQVEQRKgRBBQOVFERIhUVhVAUQVCAAEFVVUCAQ)

Shift to Human when rage below 40 via !Starsurge!>!Sunfire!>!Mangle!

[Non ToI but with Boomcatweaving](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/druid/guardian/elunes-chosen/DAQRQFUEiFQVEQRKgRBBQOVFERIhUVhVAUQVCAQEFVVUCAQ)

It's back from the dead from DF beta same idea as above but we !Starsurge!>!Sunfire!>!Rake!>!Rip!>Convoke>!Rip!. It's probably not worth it but it's fun to check

[Catweaving no moonless night](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/druid/guardian/druid-of-the-claw/DAQRAEUAiFQVERRKkRFBQOVFERIhUVhVIQQUCAQEFVVUBE)

As above but you now shift every 6 !Mangle!

[Catweaving with moonless night](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/druid/guardian/druid-of-the-claw/DAQRAEUAiFQVERRKkRFBQOVFERIhUVhVEUQUCAQEFVVUBE)

As above but replacing !Rip! with bite because it should proc arcane damage and I wanna see the difference

[catweaving is lame](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/druid/guardian/druid-of-the-claw/DAQBAUFAiFQVERRKlQFBQOVFERIhUVhVEUQUCAQEFVVUBA)

Never shift version

[catweaving is lame Toi Version](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/talent-calc/druid/guardian/druid-of-the-claw/DAQBAUFAiFQVERRKlQFBQOVFEVKAVRVVEUQUBBEFVVUBQ)

Same idea but we spam !Ironfur! instead of !Maul! (unless we have a ravage proc)
