<BossCard title="Ulgrax the Devourer" id="228713">
- Pool AP for movement before soaking [Carnivorous Contest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=457668/carnivorous-contest) to maximize uptime.
- Let your !Force of Nature! treants spread !Moonfire! for you on adds during intermission.
- TBD
</BossCard>

<BossCard title="The Bloodbound Horror" image="raids/nerubar/horror.webp">
- Commit !Barkskin! when you take frontal and it's your turn to go downstairs.
- Target adds instantly, and run towards the far add to cleave it with !Starfall!.
- Pool AP for easier movement before boss uses [Grasp from Beyond](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=443042/grasp-from-beyond) (tentacles).
- Pool AP before boss uses 
</BossCard>

<BossCard title="Sikran" id="219853">
- Be positioned so you don't have to run across the room to drop ghost when you're targeted by [Phase Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=433475/phase-blades).
- Blast the boss.
</BossCard>

<BossCard title="Rasha'nan" id="224552">
- Be proactive with running out when you're targeted by [Spinneret's Strands](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=434089/spinnerets-strands), you can pool AP before mechanic comes for easier movement and !Wild Charge! to break the web and get back in the group, but be mindful to stick with the other webbed players and avoid the raid group.
- Pool AP before taking gateway when boss is moving, use !Wild Charge! either in Human Form on someone further ahead than you, or in Travel Form to gain distance. Use !Wrath! with !Fluid Form! talented to shift back into !Moonkin Form! and reduce the globals spent.
- Use !Barkskin! if you feel like you're in danger, it's very good when adds spawn in case you get aggro.
