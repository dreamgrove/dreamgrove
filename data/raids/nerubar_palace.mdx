<BossCard title="Rasha'nan" id="224552">
- Be proactive with running out when you're targeted by [Spinneret's Strands](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=434089/spinnerets-strands), you can pool AP before mechanic comes for easier movement and !Wild Charge! to break the web and get back in the group, but be mindful to stick with the other webbed players and avoid the raid group.
- Pool AP before taking gateway when boss is moving, use !Wild Charge! either in Human Form on someone further ahead than you, or in Travel Form to gain distance. Use !Wrath! with !Fluid Form! talented to shift back into !Moonkin Form! and reduce the globals spent.
- Use !Barkskin! if you feel like you're in danger, it's very good when adds spawn in case you get aggro.
