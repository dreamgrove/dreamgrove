<BossCard title="Plexus Sentinel" id='233814'>
- [*Balance] <Talents name={"Plexus Sentinel Talents"} talents={"CYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUmtMGzMwDY2GLzMDYmxYZmtZsMmZMzsYMzYmZshFGgBYbbshpZmlBAAAAbMzMGYzAD"}/>
</BossCard>

<BossCard title="Loom'ithar" id='233815'>
- [*Balance] <Talents name={"Loom'ithar talents"} talents={"CYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUmtMGzMwDYWGLzMDwMGLzsNjlxMjZmFjZGzMjNswAMAbbjNMNzsMAAAAYzMzMGYzAD"}/>
- [*Balance] Accept that you will do very little damage to the tangle adds. Swap to them if necessary.
- [*Balance] Can hold CDs to get a use of them in the last phase since there is a dmg amp, but will depend on timer.
</BossCard>

<BossCard title="Soulbinder Naazindhri" id='233816'>
- [*Balance] <Talents name={"Soulbinder Keeper Talents"} talents={"CYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUmtMGzMwDYWYZmZAmxMLzsNjlxMjZmFjxYmZshFGgBYbbshpZmlBAAAAbmZmxAbGDD"}/>
- [*Balance] <Talents name={"Soulbinder EC Talents"} talents={"CYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUmtmxYmBYWGLzMzCDzsYWmZZmZbmZmZmZxsMGGshFGgxy2MbYMbDgJAAAALMjBYzAD"}/>
- [*Balance] By far Balance's worst fight this tier. Both builds are playable, where the Keeper one edges out when your raid is efficient at killing the adds.
- [*Balance] Wait until you've landed after the knockback before using Wild Charge as you drop a puddle on the floor when you touch the ground.
</BossCard>

<BossCard title="Forgeweaver Araz" id='247989'>
- [*Balance] <Talents name={"Forgeweaver Talents"} talents={"CYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUmtmxYmBeAzCLzMDwMMLzsNzsMmZmZmFjxwMjNswAMAbbjFMNzsMAAAAYzMzMGYzAD"}/>
- [*Balance] Delay your 2nd use of !194223|CA! and !Convoke the Spirits! for the dmg amp phase that happens around 3:30 and send both charges of !194223|CA!.
- [*Balance] Sunfire the [Arcane Manifestation's](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=242586/arcane-manifestation) as they spawn.
- [*Balance] If your guild allows it, stand in the center of the room during intermission to !Starfall! all [Arcane Collector](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=243256/arcane-collector) adds.
- [*Balance] Be careful of your positioning if you are assigned to !Typhoon! adds to knock them in the right direction.
</BossCard>

<BossCard title="The Soul Hunters" id="237661">
- [*Balance] <Talents name={"The Soul Hunters Talents"} talents={"CYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUmtMGzMwDYWGLzMDwMLmlZWmZ2mZmZmZWMLjhBbYhBYssNzGGz2AYCAAAwCzMDwmxwA"}/>
- [*Balance] You can use !Wild Charge! to cancel the pull whenever you have the [Devourer's Ire](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1222232/devourers-ire) debuff. If you don't have the debuff, wait until you've landed and make sure you're not targeted by [The Hunt](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=1227809/the-hunt) before leaving melee.
- [*Balance] You can cancel your !Nature's Grace! buff before pulling and start casting at 2 seconds on the timer with two !Wrath! casts. If you spellqueue correctly you will have both stacks of !Nature's Grace! for your opener.
- [*Balance] Don't press !102560|Incarn! during intermission.
- [*Balance] Can save a floating charge of !102560|Incarn! for a decent amount of !Gathering Moonlight! stacks.
</BossCard>

<BossCard title="Fractillus" id='237861'>
- [*Balance] <Talents name={"Fractillus Talents"} talents={"CYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUmtMGzMwDYWGLzMDwMGLzsNjlxMjZmFjZGzMjNswAMAbbjNMNzsMAAAAYjZmxAbGDD"}/>
- [*Balance] Make sure to have defensives ready for the later wall breaks as you'll have a dangerous amount of [Crystal Lacerations](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1232760/crystal-lacerations) stacks.
</BossCard>

<BossCard title="Nexus-King Salhadaar" id='237763'>
