[*Balance] <Talents name={"Balance Vexie Talents"} talents={"CYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUmtMGzMwDYWYZmZAzMLzsMz2MWYmxMzyMGjZmxGWYAGgttxCmmZWGBAAAYjZMAbGzYA"}/>

[*Feral] <Talents name={"Feral Vexie Talents"} talents={"CcGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmZb2MzCzYmZb2YsNzMz8AzMAAAAAAbBzGMmZUzYWYZGjxMzMAAAAAAAYAAAAEAMLzs0sNzyGMzAwiZwA"}/>
- [*Balance] Hold your 3rd use of !205636|Force of Nature! and your 2nd use of !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! to make use of both inside lust for intermission damage amp.
- [*Balance] Pool AP for easy movement if you're targeted by [Spew Oil](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=459666/spew-oil).
- [*Balance] Can use !Mass Entanglement! on the [Support Rig](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=234557/support-rig/mythic-encounter-journal) adds in intermission on mythic difficulty.
- [*Feral] Use first set of cooldowns on pull, and if necessary, hold !Berserk!/!Convoke the Spirits! for intermissions. Continue to use !Tiger's Fury! on cooldown.
- Use !Barkskin! when soaking [Oil Canister](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1216731/oil-canister) on mythic difficulty.
- [*Feral] You can back away from the boss and utilize !Wild Charge! in !Cat Form! to get behind the boss quickly for intermission, if there is still an oil puddle in the way.
- [*Feral] Use !Predatory Swiftness! proc on !Entangling Roots! during intermission to keep [Support Rig's](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=234557/support-rig/mythic-encounter-journal) away from melee. If you're on the first one, you'll need to refresh later in the phase.
- [*Feral] For the third [Support Rig](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=234557/support-rig/mythic-encounter-journal) of each phase, you can use !Mass Entanglement! or !Ursol's Vortex! paired with !Entangling Vortex! and it will last long enough.

<BossCard title="Cauldron of Carnage" id="229181">
[*Balance] <Talents name={"Balance Cauldron Talents"} talents={"CYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUmtMGzMwDYWYZmZAzMLjlZ2mxCzMmZWmxMjZmxGWYAGgttxCmmZWGBAAAYjZMAbGzYA"}/>

[*Feral] <Talents name={"Feral Cauldron Talents"} talents={"CcGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmZb2MzCzYmZb2YsNzMjZmBAAAAAYLYWgxMjaGzCLzMjxMzMAAAAAAAYAAAAEAMbzs0sNzyGYGAWMDG"}/>
- [*Balance] Can swap out !Stellar Flare! for !Wild Surges! if it makes the fight easier for you. !Stellar Flare! can gain some value in intermission if you manage to keep it up on both targets.
- [*Balance] On Torq (gorilla) side, pool AP for easier movement to better dodge swirlies before boss uses [Thunderdrum Salvo](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=463840/thunderdrum-salvo). **Do not get cut off and don't cut off others with your swirlie!**
- Can use !Mass Entanglement! on the [Voltaic Image](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1213994/voltaic-image) adds as they fixate players.
- [*Balance] On Flarendo (dino) side, position close to boss and !Wild Charge! to the bomb soak.
- [*Feral] During the intermissions, make sure to dot up both Flarendo and Torq.
- [*Feral] After intermissions, use !Skull Bash! or !Wild Charge! to charge to whichever boss you are attacking. Be mindful of the ground when you do so.
- [*Feral] On Torq (gorilla) side, stack with melee, and stagger [Pool Drops](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=463840/thunderdrum-salvo) in a predictable direction across the boss.
- [*Feral] Any [Voltaic Images](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1213994/voltaic-image) you miss with !Mass Entanglement! can instead be rooted with !Entangling Roots!, using !Predatory Swiftness! procs.
- [*Feral] If you're forced out of melee on Flarendo (dino) side, take advantage of !Lunar Inspiration!, bad casts and overcapping combo points is better than overcapping energy. (That being said, try to not be stuck out of melee)
- Use defensives for [Scrapbomb](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=473650/scrapbomb) detonations. This will still damage you on Torq's side of the arena.

<BossCard title="Rik Reverb" image="raids/undermine/rikreverb.webp">
[*Balance] <Talents name={"Balance Rik Reverb Talents"} talents={"CYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUmtMGzMwDYWYZmZAzMLzsMz2MWYmxMzyMGjZmxGWYAGgttxCmmZWGBAAAYjZMAbGzYA"}/>

[*Feral] <Talents name={"Feral Rik Reverb Talents"} talents={"CcGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmZb2MzCzYmZb2YsNzMz8AzMAAAAAAbBDDjZG1MmFWmZGjZMDAAAAAAAGAAAABAz2MLNbzssBzMAsYGM"}/>
- Commit defensives when soaking [Amplifier Pylons](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=236511/amplifier).
- [*Balance] On mythic difficulty, be proactive when targeted by [Faulty Zap](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=466961/faulty-zap) to break the shield on the pylons.
- The boss is immune during the intermission, save cooldowns for after it ends!
- Intermissions are a superb time to use !Bear Form! into !Frenzied Regeneration!.
- [*Feral] When the boss casts [Sparkblast Ignition](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=472306/sparkblast-ignition), try to !Primal Wrath! as many [Pyrotechnics](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=233623/pyrotechnics) as you can.

[*Balance] <Talents name={"Balance Stix Talents"} talents={"CYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUmtMGzMwDYWGLzMDYmZzsMzyMzCzMzYWmxYGzwGWAwAssNWw0MzyAAAAgNmZmBsZMM"}/>

- [*Feral] You should probably play Balance instead.
- [*Feral] You can optionally replace !Lunar Inspiration! with !Rampant Ferocity! for more AoE, if you're able to get the mobs stacked well enough.
- [*Balance] Use lorrgs to double check which add sets to use cooldowns on. Generally the first set of adds are not necessary to send your cooldowns on as your raid has lust running for this.
- [*Balance] If you are the only Moonkin on your team, you can use !Growl! to taunt the boss before he uses the first [Electromagnetic Sorting](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=464399/electromagnetic-sorting) of the fight so you are not eligible to get picked for ball on the harder sets of the fight until the very end when the boss has cycled through every player. 
- [*Balance] You should cap on AP before the boss is about to use [Electromagnetic Sorting](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=464399/electromagnetic-sorting) and start casting !Starfall! a few seconds before the boss starts casting and use your cooldowns as he begins casting and keep casting !Starfall!. 
- [*Balance] Your Starfall **will** rip aggro on the [Junkyard Hyena's](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=231935/junkyard-hyena) that spawn around the room. Be careful of your positioning here. Try to be close to a tank that can take the threat from you. Consider using !Ursol's Vortex! or ask for an external if you're in danger.
- Make sure to prioritize damaging [Territorial Bombshells](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=231531/territorial-bombshell). These are the highest priority add, as running into them will wipe your raid.
- [*Balance] [Stix Bunjunker Kill Video](https://youtu.be/OJO_rHR0bdI?si=MqffSfDIt8CozGo2)
- [*Feral] At the end of each intermission, you can quickly re-enter melee range via !Wild Charge!.

<BossCard title="Sprocketmonger Lockenstock" id="230583">
[*Feral] <Talents name={"Feral Sprocketmonger Talents"} talents={"CcGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmZb2MzCzYmZb2YsNzMjZmBAAAAAYLYYYMzomxsMWmxYMDDAAAAAAMwAAAAIAY2mZpZbmlNYmBgFzgB"}/>

[*Balance] <Talents name={"Balance Sprocketmonger Talents"} talents={"CYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUmtMGzMwDYWYZmZAzMLjlZ2mxCzMmZWmxMjZmxGWYAGgttxCmmZWGBAAAYjZMAbGzYA"}/>
- [*Balance] Feral is generally a better spec for this fight as the heavy movement can feel rough for Moonkin and melee generally has an easier time on this boss.
- [*Balance] If you get chosen to soak a far mine, run out quickly as the timing on some of the mine sets are very tight.
- [*Balance] Consider getting a sound cue or countdown for when to run out and bait the [drill mechanic](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1216508/screw-up).
- [*Balance] Be wary of using Wild Charge as you can hit a mine on the conveyor belt, someone with another color or a drill on the ground.
