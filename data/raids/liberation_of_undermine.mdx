[*Balance] <Talents name={"Balance Vexie Talents"} talents={"CYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUmtMGzMwDYWYZmZAzMLzsMz2MWYmxMzyMGjZmxGWYAGgttxCmmZWGBAAAYjZMAbGzYA"}/>

[*Feral] <Talents name={"Feral Vexie Talents"} talents={"CcGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmZb2MzCzYmZb2YsNzMz8AzMAAAAAAbBzGMmZUzYWYZGjxMzMAAAAAAAYAAAAEAMLzs0sNzyGMzAwiZwA"}/>

- [*Balance] Hold your 3rd use of !205636|Force of Nature! and your 2nd use of !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! to make use of both inside lust for intermission damage amp.
- [*Balance] Pool AP for easy movement if you're targeted by [Spew Oil](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=459666/spew-oil).
- [*Balance] Can use !Mass Entanglement! on the [Support Rig](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=234557/support-rig/mythic-encounter-journal) adds in intermission on mythic difficulty.
- [*Feral] Use first set of cooldowns on pull, and if necessary, hold !Berserk!/!Convoke the Spirits! for intermissions. Continue to use !Tiger's Fury! on cooldown.
- Use !Barkskin! when soaking [Oil Canister](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1216731/oil-canister) on mythic difficulty.
- [*Feral] You can back away from the boss and utilize !Wild Charge! in !Cat Form! to get behind the boss quickly for intermission, if there is still an oil puddle in the way.
- [*Feral] Use !Predatory Swiftness! proc on !Entangling Roots! during intermission to keep [Support Rig's](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=234557/support-rig/mythic-encounter-journal) away from melee. If you're on the first one, you'll need to refresh later in the phase.
- [*Feral] For the third [Support Rig](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=234557/support-rig/mythic-encounter-journal) of each phase, you can use !Mass Entanglement! or !Ursol's Vortex! paired with !Entangling Vortex! and it will last long enough.

<BossCard title="Cauldron of Carnage" id="229181">
[*Balance] <Talents name={"Balance Cauldron Talents"} talents={"CYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUmtMGzMwDYWYZmZAzMLjlZ2mxCzMmZWmxMjZmxGWYAGgttxCmmZWGBAAAYjZMAbGzYA"}/>

[*Feral] <Talents name={"Feral Cauldron Talents"} talents={"CcGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmZb2MzCzYmZb2YsNzMjZmBAAAAAYLYWgxMjaGzCLzMjxMzMAAAAAAAYAAAAEAMbzs0sNzyGYGAWMDG"}/>
- [*Balance] Can swap out !Stellar Flare! for !Wild Surges! if it makes the fight easier for you. !Stellar Flare! can gain some value in intermission if you manage to keep it up on both targets.
- [*Balance] On Torq (gorilla) side, pool AP for easier movement to better dodge swirlies before boss uses [Thunderdrum Salvo](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=463840/thunderdrum-salvo). **Do not get cut off and don't cut off others with your swirlie!**
- Can use !Mass Entanglement! on the !1213994|Voltaic Image! adds as they fixate players.
- [*Balance] On Flarendo (dino) side, position close to boss and !Wild Charge! to the bomb soak.
- [*Feral] During the intermissions, make sure to dot up both Flarendo and Torq.
- [*Feral] After intermissions, use !Skull Bash! or !Wild Charge! to charge to whichever boss you are attacking. Be mindful of the ground when you do so.
- [*Feral] On Torq (gorilla) side, stack with melee, and stagger [Pool Drops](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=463840/thunderdrum-salvo) in a predictable direction across the boss.
- [*Feral] Any [Voltaic Images](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1213994/voltaic-image) you miss with !Mass Entanglement! can instead be rooted with !Entangling Roots!, using !Predatory Swiftness! procs.
- [*Feral] If you're forced out of melee on Flarendo (dino) side, take advantage of !Lunar Inspiration!, bad casts and overcapping combo points is better than overcapping energy. (That being said, try to not be stuck out of melee)
- Use defensives for [Scrapbomb](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=473650/scrapbomb) detonations. This will still damage you on Torq's side of the arena.

<BossCard title="Rik Reverb" image="raids/undermine/rikreverb.webp">
[*Balance] <Talents name={"Balance Rik Reverb Talents"} talents={"CYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUmtMGzMwDYWYZmZAzMLzsMz2MWYmxMzyMGjZmxGWYAGgttxCmmZWGBAAAYjZMAbGzYA"}/>

[*Feral] <Talents name={"Feral Rik Reverb Talents"} talents={"CcGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmZb2MzCzYmZb2YsNzMz8AzMAAAAAAbBDDjZG1MmFWmZGjZMDAAAAAAAGAAAABAz2MLNbzssBzMAsYGM"}/>
- Commit defensives when soaking [Amplifier Pylons](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=236511/amplifier).
- [*Balance] On mythic difficulty, be proactive when targeted by [Faulty Zap](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=466961/faulty-zap) to break the shield on the pylons.
- The boss is immune during the intermission, save cooldowns for after it ends!
- Intermissions are a superb time to use !Bear Form! into !Frenzied Regeneration!.
- [*Feral] When the boss casts [Sparkblast Ignition](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=472306/sparkblast-ignition), try to !Primal Wrath! as many [Pyrotechnics](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=233623/pyrotechnics) as you can.

<BossCard title="Stix Bunkjunker" id="230322">
[*Balance] <Talents name={"Balance Stix Talents"} talents={"CYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUmtMGzMwDYWGLzMDYmZzsMzyMzCzMzYWmxYGzwGWAwAssNWw0MzyAAAAgNmZmBsZMM"}/>

[*Feral] <Talents name={"Feral Stix Talents"} talents={"CcGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmZb2MzCzYmZb2YsNzMz8AzMAAAAAAbBDDjZG1MmlxyMGjZmZAAAAAAAwAAAAIAY2mZpZbmlNwMAsYGM"}/>
- [*Feral] You should probably play Balance instead.
- [*Feral] You can optionally replace !Lunar Inspiration! with !Rampant Ferocity! for more AoE, if you're able to get the mobs stacked well enough.
- [*Balance] Use lorrgs to double check which add sets to use cooldowns on. Generally the first set of adds are not necessary to send your cooldowns on as your raid has lust running for this.
- [*Balance] If you are the only Moonkin on your team, you can use !Growl! to taunt the boss before he uses the first [Electromagnetic Sorting](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=464399/electromagnetic-sorting) of the fight so you are not eligible to get picked for ball on the harder sets of the fight until the very end when the boss has cycled through every player. 
- [*Balance] You should cap on AP before the boss is about to use [Electromagnetic Sorting](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=464399/electromagnetic-sorting) and start casting !Starfall! a few seconds before the boss starts casting and use your cooldowns as he begins casting and keep casting !Starfall!. 
- [*Balance] Your Starfall **will** rip aggro on the [Junkyard Hyena's](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=231935/junkyard-hyena) that spawn around the room. Be careful of your positioning here. Try to be close to a tank that can take the threat from you. Consider using !Ursol's Vortex! or ask for an external if you're in danger.
- Make sure to prioritize damaging [Territorial Bombshells](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=231531/territorial-bombshell). These are the highest priority add, as running into them will wipe your raid.
- [*Balance] [Stix Bunjunker Kill Video](https://youtu.be/OJO_rHR0bdI?si=MqffSfDIt8CozGo2)
- [*Feral] At the end of each intermission, you can quickly re-enter melee range via !Wild Charge!.

<BossCard title="Sprocketmonger Lockenstock" id="230583">
[*Feral] <Talents name={"Feral Sprocketmonger Talents"} talents={"CcGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmZb2MzCzYmZb2YsNzMjZmBAAAAAYLYYYMzomxsMWmxYMDDAAAAAAMwAAAAIAY2mZpZbmlNYmBgFzgB"}/>

[*Balance] <Talents name={"Balance Sprocketmonger Talents"} talents={"CYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUmtMGzMwDYWYZmZAzMLjlZ2mxCzMmZWmxMjZmxGWYAGgttxCmmZWGBAAAYjZMAbGzYA"}/>
- [*Balance] Feral is generally a better spec for this fight as the heavy movement can feel rough for Moonkin and melee generally has an easier time on this boss.
- [*Balance] If you get chosen to soak a far mine, run out quickly as the timing on some of the mine sets are very tight.
- [*Balance] Consider getting a sound cue or countdown for when to run out and bait the [drill mechanic](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1216508/screw-up).
- [*Balance] Be wary of using Wild Charge as you can hit a mine on the conveyor belt, someone with another color or a drill on the ground.

<BossCard title="One-Armed Bandit" id='228458'>

[*Feral] <Talents name={"Feral One-Armed Bandit Talents"} talents={"CcGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmZb2MzCzYmZb2YsNzMz8AzMAAAAAAbBzGMmZUzYWYZmZMmZmBAAAAAAADAAAgAgZbmlmtZW2AzAwiZwA"}/>

[*Balance] <Talents name={"One-Armed Bandit Talents"} talents={"CYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUmtMGzMwDYWGLzMDYGbmlZ2mZWGzMzYWmxYYM2wCAGgttxCmmZWGBAAAYzMzMDYzYYA"}>
     Can swap out !Convoke the Spirits! for !102560|Incarnation! if you want some more flexible cooldowns. Alternatively you can also play !Starweaver! instead of !Rattle the Stars!. Try out different talents and make a decision that fits best for you. </Talents>

- [*Balance] Be proactive and quick when running out with [The Big Hit](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=460472/the-big-hit) to drop the circle away from the raid.
- [*Balance] Don't bait [coins](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=460181/pay-line) into the shocking field puddles on the floor. 
- [*Balance] Run out quickly with [Withering Flames](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=472197/withering-flames) before asking to get dispelled. !Bear Form! is very good for this as the debuff lowers your max health. Pay attention to where your flames are going and communicate if they are going into the ranged or melee camp. A lot wipes can be prevented by calling out to be careful for traveling flames.
- [*Balance] When playing !102560|Incarnation! your cooldowns are very flexible and you can change them around to fit your guild. Use [Lorrgs](https://lorrgs.io/spec_ranking/druid-balance/onearmed-bandit) to check where other moonkins are sending their cooldowns as well. Try and save charges of !194223|CA!/!102560|Inc! for the last phase as there is a DPS check.
- [*Balance] You can use !Mass Entanglement! or !Ursol's Vortex! on the final set of adds in the last phase. Communicate this with your team to make sure you have a plan on how to deal with those adds.

<BossCard title="Mugzee" id='229953'>
[*Feral] <Talents name={"Feral Mug'Zee Talents"} talents={"CcGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmZb2MzCzYmZb2YsNzMjZmBAAAAAYLYWgxMjaGzCLzMjxMzMAAAAAAAYAAAAEAMbzs0sNzyGYGAWMDG"}/>

[*Balance] <Talents name={"Mug'Zee Talents"} talents={"CYGAkuH5GdQpDrgY32rlVGnyqBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUmlMGzMwDYWGLzMDYmxYZmtZswMzMzsMjZGzMjNsAgBYbbsgpZmlRBAgAYjZmBYzYYA"}/>

- [*Balance] **Make sure to not pre-pull since the boss will start on whichever side of the room the person pulling is standing on.**
- [*Balance] !Convoke the Spirits! and !205636|Force of Nature! can be tricky on this boss as the [Mk II Electro Shcoker](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=230316/mk-ii-electro-shocker) adds have a 99% damage reduction shield on them until they get broken out by [Finger Gun](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=466509/stormfury-finger-gun) and both your !Convoke the Spirits! and your !205636|Force of Nature! treants will randomly use spells on them. Be careful of relying on !205636|Force of Nature! to refresh your !Moonfire! whenever the adds are up.
- [*Balance] Before pulling the boss, you should position yourself on the far wall on the dirt side of the room in order to outrange the adds during your first use of !Convoke the Spirits!. If you are using a 1:30 cooldown trinket like [House of Cards](https://www.wowhead.com/item=230027/house-of-cards?bonus=4795&class=11&ilvl=678&spec=102) you can hold your 3rd use of !205636|Force of Nature! so your cooldowns line up as the first set of adds shields are broken before the second set spawns. If you are using a 2:00 cooldown trinket like [Signet of the Priory](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219308/signet-of-the-priory?bonus=4795&class=11&ilvl=678&spec=102) you can try using it before the pull timer is over in order to have your second use happen before the second set of adds spawn.
- [*Balance] Utilize !Wild Charge! during the intermission charges to decrease downtime. Save up AP and spend with !Starsurge! for the intense movement parts. Don't be afraid to sacrifice some downtime in order to not get hit by the [Bulletstorm](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=471574/bulletstorm). In most situations you can pre-move to a safe spot before the boss charges to reduce the movement needed. Having a plan for this can reduce greatly reduce your deaths or wipes.
- Consider using !Bear Form! whenever your team is stacking for the [Frostshatter Spears](www.wowhead.com/spell=466480/frostshatter-spear). The application of this debuff can do a lot of damage if you're stacked on people.
- [*Balance] Use !Regrowth! on yourself whenever the [Unstable Crawler Mines](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=466539/unstable-crawler-mines) happen. Soaking the mines gives your entire raid a healing debuff, and the increased healing taken and damage reduction from !Protective Growth! and !Forestwalk! is good for this. 
- Should use !Mass Entanglement! to root the [Unstable Crawler Mines](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=466539/unstable-crawler-mines) to make it easier for people to not accidentally soak them, and also make it easier to do the [Frostshatter Spears](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=466480/frostshatter-spear) mechanic in the last phase.
- You can use non-form !Wild Charge! to get out of [Gaols](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=472631/earthshaker-gaol) before it spawns. You can macro it to @focus target and focus a healer that is permanently staying out of the gaols. The timing for this can be tricky and it can be hard to get this consistently. Discuss with your guild or raid leader if this is a strategy you guys want to do. Being assigned Evoker's Rescue or Priest's Life Grip is also an option.

[*Balance] <Talents name={"Gallywix Talents"} talents={"CYGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUmtMGzMwDYWGLzMDYmZbmlZ2mxCzMzYWmxYMjxGWAwAstNWw0MzyAAAAgNmZmBsZMM"}/>
- [*Balance] You can enter !Solar Eclipse! on pull and delay your cooldowns by three !Wrath! casts in order to use them on the [Total Destruction](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1214369/total-destruction) shield and to have !Convoke the Spirits! for the tight movement section at the start of the fight.
- [*Balance] Can either send !Barkskin! on pull to have it back for the first [Canister](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1217987/combination-canisters) soak or use it during the [Total Destruction](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1214369/total-destruction) shield.
- [*Balance] Plan your defensives
- [*Balance] You can hold your second set of !Celestial Alignment! to line up with the second set of [Technican](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=237192/giga-juiced-technician) adds or send it with your second use of !205636|Force of Nature! on the first set of adds.
- [*Balance] You can use your second !Convoke the Spirits! into the third set of [Technican](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=237192/giga-juiced-technician) adds. 
- [*Balance] !Barkskin! and !Regrowth! are good defensives to use whenever you have a healing debuff.
- [*Balance] Have a plan for how to deal with [Suppression](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=467182/suppression) during the final parts of the fight.
- [*Balance] Pool AP to prepare for when you have to move from the swirlies during intermission.
- Use !Soothe! to purge the [Lumbering Rage](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1216852/lumbering-rage) effect from the [Wrenchmonger](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=231939/darkfuse-wrenchmonger) adds.
- Drop an !Ursol's Vortex! whenever the !Darkfuse Technican! adds spawn in the intermission. You can also !Solar Beam! these adds to help your tanks gather them.
