1. What's new?
    * Changes from the August 27th build 9.0.1.35707 are included.
    * APL has been update for changes, but further optimization may be possible. If you discover an improvement, please submit a report.

1. Is the new Solstice talent good?
    * With the Night Fae covenant, in most situations Fury of Elune is better. While Solstice currently sims the highest by ~1%, this is ***ONLY ON SINGLE TARGET AND YOU MUST TAKE STELLAR FLARE*** with the Night Fae covenant and Balance of All Things legendary. The flexibility of Stellar Drift & Fury of Elune outweigh the trivial sim dps gain.

1. What about bugs that are currently present on the Beta/PTR?
    * The following bugfixes are assumed for the sims:
        * Moons correctly benefit from nature buffs such as Solar Eclipse, Balance of All Things nature crit buff, Fury of Elune Sunfire damage debuff.
        * Endless Thirst conduit correctly provides 2% crit per stack.
        * The Balance of All Things crit buffs correctly applies to any queued instant spell that follows the wrath/starfire that procs Eclipse.

1. What is the 'M+' selection in the target dropdown?
    * This is an **unoptimized, very crude approximation** of a random dungeon-like encounter. The details can be found in [mplus.txt](mplus.txt). It consists of:
        * ~360s total fight time
        * ~130s to ~150s fighting one mob
        * ~30s to ~50s fighting a wave of 3 to 7 mobs, each wave random and repeating until the end of the fight
        * Random 0s to ~20s wait after each fight

1. What about conduits?
    * All sims include the covenant specific conduits (except for Kyrian) and the Fury of the Skies conduit at base rank.
    * The other potency conduits at current tuning contribute less than 1% and are not worth simming.
    * The Kyrian conduit can desync Kindred Spirits from other CDs so is not worth simming.

1. What about soulbinds?
    * Soulbinds are not yet fully implemented in SimC.

1. How does SimC handle Convoke the Spirits (Night Fae)?
    * SimC assumes it will cast 2 healing spells, 1 Starfall if it isn't up, 1 Moonfire if you have a target without it, then balance out the remaining between Starsurge, Wrath, and Moonfire on any further un-dotted targets.

1. How does SimC handle Kindred Spirits (Kyrian)?
    * SimC assumes that you are bonding with someone who does the exact same damage as you. The additional damage done by you AND your partner are attributed to you.

1. Are the sims updated for _____ ?
    * At the top of the HTML report, in the SimulationCraft banner, you will find the git build code.
    * Goto `http://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/commits/<enter git build code here>` to see all the changes to SimC that have been incorporated into the sim.

1. What are the base stats used in the sims?
    * The base profile can be found in [sandbag.txt](sandbag.txt)

1. How can I run my own beta sims?
    * Instructions on creating the command line version and how to use it can be found in [how_to_build.txt](how_to_build.txt)
    * A copy of the command line program can be found as `simc_(date).rar` but this can often be outdated.

1. How do I sim a covenant?
    * Add the line **covenant=covenant_name**

1. How do I sim a conduit?
    * Add the line **soulbind=conduit_name:rank/conduit2_name:rank/...**

1. How do I sim a legendary?
    * Legendary effects are added to gear as a bonus_id. Add the line for a tabard with the legendary effect from [leg_x_cov.txt](leg_x_cov.txt)
